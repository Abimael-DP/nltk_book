    <title> Goals </title>

    <para>
    The field of natural language processing, or NLP, is experiencing
    rapid growth as its theories and methods are applied to a rich
    variety of new language technologies.  Ubiquitous computing
    devices demand keyboardless interfaces, often with text,
    speech and dialogue technologies.  The explosion of text and
    multimedia content on the world-wide web demands new information
    extraction, translation and summarisation technologies.  Linguists
    and computer scientists need to have a working knowledge of NLP in
    order to participate in this exciting new endeavour.
    </para>

    <para>
    In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was a promising
    convergence between the fields of linguistics and NLP.  (This had
    been a feature of the 1960s, e.g. with the application of the SPE
    model in speech synthesis systems.)  Computational linguists often
    looked to linguistics as a source of knowledge about language.
    Over the last decade we have seen a new divergence, as
    computational linguists have discovered that linguistic analyses
    often failed to account for the linguistic patterns attested in
    the large corpora used to develop their systems.  However, once
    linguists learn to work with these large datasets, their own
    analytical work will benefit, leading to broader coverage of their
    theories, and earlier refutation of false hypotheses.  The result,
    we expect, will be new opportunities for cross-fertilization
    between linguistics and NLP.
    </para>

    <para>
    Our goal in developing the Natural Language Toolkit is to
    equip linguists to work with these large datasets,
    create robust models of linguistic phenomena, and deploy them in
    working language technologies.  In order to do this, we present
    a carefully balanced selection of theoretical foundations and
    practical application.  For example, we believe that readers must
    understand parsing algorithms, but that they must also be able to
    implement a parser.  The intended audience of these materials is much
    broader than linguists, however.  We believe they will have broad
    appeal from humanities computing all the way to artificial
    intelligence, and from corpus linguistics to information
    extraction.
    There are important
    opportunities for linguists to contribute their insights to the
    future development of NLP and, in the reverse direction, to apply
    the results of NLP research back in linguistics.

    <title>NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit</title>

    <para>
    The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) was developed in conjunction
    with a computational linguistics course at the University of
    Pennsylvania in 2001.  It can be downloaded for free from
    <literal>nltk.sourceforge.net</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
    We chose Python because it has a shallow learning curve, its
    syntax and semantics are transparent, and it has good
    string-handling functionality.  As an interpreted language, Python
    facilitates interactive exploration.  As an object-oriented
    language, Python permits data and methods to be encapsulated and
    re-used easily.  Python comes with an extensive standard library,
    including tools for graphical programming and numerical
    processing.
    </para>

    <para>
    NLTK was designed with six requirements in mind.  First, NLTK is
    <emphasis>easy to use</emphasis>.  The primary purpose of the
    toolkit is to allow students to concentrate on building natural
    language processing systems.  The more time students must spend
    learning to use the toolkit, the less useful it is.  Second, we
    have made a significant effort to ensure that all the data
    structures and interfaces are <emphasis>consistent</emphasis>.
    Third, the toolkit is <emphasis>extensible</emphasis>, easily
    accommodating new components, whether those components replicate
    or extend the toolkit's existing functionality.  Moreover, the
    toolkit is organized so that it is usually obvious where
    extensions would fit into the toolkit's infrastructure.  Fourth,
    the toolkit is designed to be <emphasis>simple</emphasis>, not
    hiding the complexities of building an NLP system, but providing
    intuitive structures.  Fifth, the toolkit is
    <emphasis>modular</emphasis>, so that the interaction between
    different components of the toolkit is minimized, and uses simple,
    well-defined interfaces.  In particular, it should be possible to
    complete individual projects using small parts of the toolkit,
    without needing to understand how they interact with the rest of
    the toolkit.  This allows students to learn how to use the toolkit
    incrementally throughout a course.  Modularity also makes it
    easier to change and extend the toolkit.  Finally, the toolkit is
    <emphasis>well documented</emphasis>, including nomenclature,
    data structures, and implementations.
    </para>

    <para>
    Contrasting with these requirements are three non-requirements.
    First, while the toolkit provides a wide range of functions, it is
    not intended to be encyclopedic.  There should be a wide variety
    of ways in which students can extend the toolkit.  Second, while
    the toolkit should be efficient enough that students can use their
    NLP systems to perform meaningful tasks, it does not need to be
    highly optimized for runtime performance.  Such optimizations
    often involve more complex algorithms, and sometimes require the
    use of C++, making the toolkit harder to install.  Third, we have
    avoided the the use of clever programming tricks, since clear
    implementations are far preferable to ingenious yet indecipherable
    ones.
    </para>


    <para> The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) defines a basic
    infrastructure that can be used to build NLP programs in Python.
    It provides: </para>

    <title> Overview of NLTK </title>

    <para>NLTK provides basic classes for representing data relevant to NLP.
    NLTK also provides standard interfaces for performing NLP tasks, along
    with standard implementations of each task.</para>

    <para>NLTK is organized into a collection of task-specific modules and
    packages.  Each contains data-oriented classes to represent NLP information,
    and task-oriented classes to encapsulate the resources and methods needed
    to perform a particular task.</para>

    <para>NLTK has the following modules:

    <title> Python Overview </title>

    <para> Introduction to processing lists and strings. </para>

    <para> First, list initialization, length, indexing, slicing: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> a = ['colourless', 'green', 'ideas']
>>> print a
['colourless', 'green', 'ideas']
>>> a
['colourless', 'green', 'ideas']
>>> len(a)
3
>>> a[1]
'green'
>>> a[-1]
'ideas'
>>> a[1:]
['green', 'ideas']
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Note that we had to explicitly print the result of the
      assignment above, using <literal>print a</literal>.  We achieved
      the same result by giving the variable name, which Python evaluates
      and prints.  (For conciseness we henceforth omit these print statements.)
      Below we see use of list concatenation, sorting and reversal.  The final
      command concatenates two list elements.
    </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> b = a + ['sleep', 'furiously']
['colourless', 'green', 'ideas', 'sleep', 'furiously']
>>> b.sort()
['colourless', 'furiously', 'green', 'ideas', 'sleep']
>>> b.reverse()
['sleep', 'ideas', 'green', 'furiously', 'colourless']
>>> b[2] + b[1]
'greenideas'
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Simple for loop: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> for w in b:
...    print w[0]
...
's'
'i'
'g'
'f'
'c'
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Miscellaneous further interesting examples:</para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> b[2][1]
'r'
>>> b.index('green')
2
>>> b[5]
IndexError: list index out of range
>>> b[0] * 3
'sleepsleepsleep'
>>> c = ' '.join(b)
'sleep ideas green furiously colourless'
>>> c.split('r')
['sleep ideas g', 'een fu', 'iously colou', 'less']
>>> map(lambda x: len(x), b)
[5, 5, 5, 9, 10]
>>> [(x, len(x)) for x in b]
[('sleep', 5), ('ideas', 5), ('green', 5), ('furiously', 9), ('colourless', 10)]
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Next we'll take a look at Python ``dictionaries'' (or associative arrays). </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> d = {}
>>> d['colourless'] = 'adj'
>>> d['furiously'] = 'adv'
>>> d['ideas'] = 'n'
>>> d.keys()
['colourless', 'furiously', 'ideas']
>>> d.values()
['adv', 'adj', 'n']
>>> d
{'furiously': 'adv', 'colourless': 'adj', 'ideas': 'n'}
>>> d.has_key('ideas')
1
>>> d.get('sleep')
None
>>> for w in d.keys():
...    print "%s [%s]," % (w, d[w]),
furiously [adv], colourless [adj], ideas [n],
]]></programlisting>

    <para> We can use dictionaries to count word occurrences.  For example,
      the following code reads <emphasis>Macbeth</emphasis> and counts the
      frequency of each word. </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> from nltk.corpus import gutenberg
# initialize a dictionary 
>>> words = {}
# tokenize Macbeth 
>>> book = gutenberg.read('shakespeare-macbeth.txt')
# process the individual tokens 
>>> for token in book['WORDS']:
    # get the token's text and normalize to lowercase 
...    word = token['TEXT'].lower()
    # get the current frequency count (or zero if it's undefined) and increment 
...    words[word] = words.get(word, 0) + 1
>>> print words['scotland']
18
# create a list of word frequencies
>>> frequencies = [(freq, word) for (word, freq) in words.items()]
# sort by frequency and reverse
>>> frequencies.sort(); frequencies.reverse()
>>> print frequencies[:10]
[(2262, 'the'), (1788, 'and'), (1356, 'to'), (1275, 'of'), (978, 'i'), (852, 'a'),
(714, 'that'), (687, 'you'), (657, 'in'), (615, 'my')]
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Finally, we look at Python's regular expression module, for
    substituting and searching within strings.  We use a utility
    function <literal>re_show</literal> to show how regular
    expressions match against substrings.
    </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> import re
>>> from nltk.util import re_show
>>> string = "colourless green ideas sleep furiously"
>>> re_show('l', string)
co{l}our{l}ess green ideas s{l}eep furious{l}y
>>> re.sub('l', 's', string)
'cosoursess green ideas sseep furioussy'
>>> re_show('green', string)
colourless {green} ideas sleep furiously
>>> re.sub('green', 'red', string)
'colourless red ideas sleep furiously'
>>> re_show('[^aeiou][aeiou]', string)
{co}{lo}ur{le}ss g{re}en{ i}{de}as s{le}ep {fu}{ri}ously
>>> re.findall('[^aeiou][aeiou]', string)
['co', 'lo', 'le', 're', ' i', 'de', 'le', 'fu', 'ri']
>>> re.findall('([^aeiou])([aeiou])', string)
[('c', 'o'), ('l', 'o'), ('l', 'e'), ('r', 'e'), (' ', 'i'), ('d', 'e'),
('l', 'e'), ('f', 'u'), ('r', 'i')]
>>> re_show('(green|sleep)', string)
colourless {green} ideas {sleep} furiously
>>> re.findall('(green|sleep)', string)
['green', 'sleep']
]]></programlisting>

    <title> Accessing NLTK </title>

    <para> NLTK consists of a set of Python
    <glossterm>modules</glossterm>, each of which defines classes and
    functions related to a single data structure or task.  Before you
    can use a module, you must <glossterm>import</glossterm> its
    contents.  The simplest way to import the contents of a module is
    to use the
    "<literal>from&nbsp;<replaceable>module</replaceable>&nbsp;import&nbsp;*</literal>"
    command.  For example, to import the contents of the
    <literal>nltk.token</literal> module, which is discussed in this
    tutorial, type: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> from nltk.token import *
]]></programlisting>
    
    <para> A disadvantage of the
    "<literal>from&nbsp;<replaceable>module</replaceable>&nbsp;import&nbsp;*</literal>" command is
    that it does not specify what objects are imported; and it is
    possible that some of the import objects will unintentionally
    cause conflicts.  To avoid this disadvantage, you can explicitly
    list the objects you wish to import.  For example, to import the
    <literal>Token</literal> and <literal>Location</literal> classes
    from the <literal>nltk.token</literal> module, type: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> from nltk.token import Token, CharSpanLocation
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Another option is to import the module itself, rather than
    its contents.  For example, to import the
    <literal>nltk.token</literal> module, type: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> import nltk.token
]]></programlisting>

    <para> Once a module is imported, its contents can then be accessed
    using fully qualified dotted names: </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[
>>> nltk.token.Token(TEXT='dog')
'dog'@[?]
>>> nltk.token.CharSpanLocation(3,5,source='source.txt')
@[3:5]
]]></programlisting>

    <para> For more information about importing, see any Python
    textbook. </para>

    <para> NLTK is distributed with several corpora, listed in
      <xref linkend="corpora"/>.  Many of these corpora are
      supported by the NLTK <literal>corpus</literal> module.
      The following code listing shows how some of these corpora
      can be accessed.

<para> <literal>TokenizerI</literal> is the first "interface"
      class we've encountered; at this point, we'll take a short
      digression to explain how interfaces are implemented in
      NLTK. </para>

<para> An <glossterm>interface</glossterm> gives a partial
      specification of the behavior of a class, including
      specifications for methods that the class should implement.  For
      example, a "comparable" interface might specify that a class
      must implement a comparison method.  Interfaces do not give a
      complete specification of a class; they only specify a minimum
      set of methods and behaviors which should be implemented by the
      class.  For example, the <literal>TokenizerI</literal> interface
      specifies that a tokenizer class must implement a
      <literal>tokenize</literal> method, which takes a
      <literal>string</literal>, and returns a list of
      <literal>Token</literal>s; but it does not specify what other
      methods the class should implement (if any).  </para>

<para> The notion of "interfaces" can be very useful in ensuring
      that different classes work together correctly.  Although the
      concept of "interfaces" is supported in many languages, such as
      Java, there is no native support for interfaces in
      Python. </para>

<para> NLTK therefore implements interfaces using classes, all
      of whose methods raise the
      <literal>NotImplementedError</literal> exception.  To
      distinguish interfaces from other classes, they are always named
      with a trailing "<literal>I</literal>".  If a class implements
      an interface, then it should be a subclass of the interface.
      For example, the <literal>WhitespaceTokenizer</literal> class implements
      the <literal>TokenizerI</literal> interface, and so it is a
      subclass of <literal>TokenizerI</literal>.  </para>

  <title>Teaching with NLTK</title>

    <para>
    Integrating theory and practice is a difficult in the framework
    of a single semester, introductory course on NLP.  Common approaches
    are to focus on theory to the exclusion of practical exercises, or
    to focus exclusively on teaching linguists how to write programs.
    However, we believe that neither approach is suitable for a
    one-semester course on NLP.  The former provides the students with
    no practical experience, while the latter usually gets bogged down
    in the mechanics of programming and doesn't succeed in teaching
    any significant NLP.  The teacher of a one-semester course faces an
    acute dilemma: forget the practical component and just teach the
    theory or teach programming and try to fit in some CL at the end
    once they can manage all the "housekeeping" functions (file I/O,
    representing and displaying grammars and trees, etc).  It is clear
    that these considerable overheads and shortcomings warrant the
    fresh approach to NLP pedagogy offered here.
    </para>

    <para>
    Apart from the practical component, CL courses may also depend on
    software for in-class demonstrations.  This context calls for
    interactive graphical user interfaces, making it possible to view
    program state (e.g. the chart of a chart parser), observe program
    execution step-by-step (e.g. execution of a finite-state machine),
    and even make minor modifications to programs in response to
    ``what if'' questions from the class.  Because of these
    difficulties it is common to avoid live demonstrations, and keep
    classes for theoretical presentations only.  Apart from being
    dull, this approach leaves students to solve important practical
    problems on their own, or to deal with them less efficiently in
    office hours.
    </para>
 
    <para>
    NLTK supports assignments of varying difficulty and scope.  In the
    simplest assignments, students experiment with existing components
    to perform a wide variety of NLP tasks.  As students become more
    familiar with the toolkit, they can be asked to modify existing
    components, or to create complete systems out of existing
    components.
    NLTK also provides students with a flexible framework for advanced
    projects.  Typical projects might involve implementing a new
    algorithm, developing a new component, or implementing a new task.
    </para>

    <para>
    This book confronts these problems by tightly integrating the
    theoretical content with a practical component based on the
    Natural Language Toolkit.  The toolkit was developed in
    conjunction with a NLP course at the University of Pennsylvania, a
    leading centre for NLP teaching and research.  The practical
    component is supported by significant corpora distributed with
    NLTK, including samples from the Linguistic Data Consortium, the
    leading publisher of linguistic data.  Key features of the toolkit
    are that students augment and replace existing components, they
    learn structured programming by example, and they manipulate
    sophisticated models from the outset.  The integrated material
    will continue to be tested in courses in 2004 at the universities
    of Pennsylvania, Edinburgh and Melbourne, along with a long list
    of other institutions listed on the NLTK website.
