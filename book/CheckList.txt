General issues:
* NLTK index
* Comments back to O'Reilly in docs/notes.txt

Outstanding issues:

ch06 doesn't mention clustering or nltk.cluster
ch06 only has only one |TRY| exercise
ch07 has a conclusion (non-standard) but no summary
ch07 needs some non-chunking exercises
ch07 could describe SRL in 7.1 as another shallow processing task
ch07 should describe NLTK's off-the-shelf NE tagger
ch07 typography should follow the simplified style of later chapters, e.g. with NP
ch07 only has two |TRY| exercises
ch08 language is more formal than necessary, less accessible than it should be
ch08 defines "string" to have a new meaning
ch08 typography should no longer use NP
ch08 section 8.6 on grammar development is incomplete (incl PE08 discussion)
ch08 assumes knowledge of "head" (did some content disappear?)
ch09 lacks our standard opening
ch09 uses :lex: role, not processed by docbook
ch09 could mention use of trees as source of features for ML
ch09 includes contents of grammar files that have changed in data distribution
ch09 has no |TRY| exercises
ch10 some names overly qualified, e.g. nltk.sem.logic.LogicParser->nltk.LogicParser
ch10 has some notational inconsistencies with "-" vs |neg|
ch11 has no |TRY| exercises
