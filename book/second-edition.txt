Plans for second edition


Notes on key changes:

* Scaling up: new sections that provide a pathway into R&D, showing how to handle larger datasets and how to interface to more specialized, industry-strength tools

* tightening up existing content to save space including smaller diagrams

* hyperlinks from electronic versions to code samples etc
