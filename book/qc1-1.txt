General issues
==============

* Will further attention be given to end-of-line word breaks? Some of the current
  breaks, particularly for code examples, seem sub-optimal. E.g. p82 6up "document" is
  split as "do cument";  p118 Warning note: "output" split as "out put"

* Hyphenation of "part of speech", "parts of speech" and "POS tagged" is currently
  inconsistent across the book -- what is the O'Reilly house style for this?

* We are assuming that the convention for italicized words within captions will be to
  set them as roman, following Loranah's email + attachment of May 12. However, it is
  unclear how this convention impacts on other expressions which have variants when they occur in
  body text; e.g., Python code, menu items, titles. Will these also be treated
  specially in captions?

* At present, menu items are rendered inconsistently as italic, cw, and roman. We
  propose to adopt italic, since this seems to be O'Reilly housestyle.

* We've suggested several changes that involve editing the content. Since
  this is not desirable from the point of view of the copy editing process, we've
  tried to minimize them, and they are generally cases which involve errors,
  inconsistencies or are likely to confuse the reader. 

* A number of the issues flagged in the QC1 PDF were already annotated with solutions
  in a previous version of the shared PDF; we've tried to reconstruct them.

pxi 5up Chapters -3 -> Chapters 1-3

pxii 2d 8-Chapter 10 -> 8-10

pxiii 4up replace the sentence:
      "Although Python 3.0 has now been released, it will be some time before 
       NLTK and the libraries it depends on are converted to use Python 3.0."
      with:
      "We are committed to porting NLTK to Python 3.0 once the libraries that
      NLTK depends on have been ported."

       under a Creative Commons license.

pxix middle: After "Linguistic Data Consortium," add "an Edward Clarence Dyason Fellowship,"

p3 Fig 1-1 caption: 
       menu items have been set as bold italic. Is this correct / consistent with the
       treatment of other double emphasis terms?
       "nltk.download()" has been set as cwi; could this be just cw?


p5 8d "the _US Presidential Inaugural Addresses_" -> "the Inaugural Address Corpus"

p46 "Your Turn": 'Language-Latin1' s/b cwi and w/o quotes (its a metavariable)

p47 Table 2-3 Delete second occurrence of "nltk.corpus.reader" in table caption.
    It should read: "more documentation can be found using help(nltk.corpus.reader)
    and by reading the online Corpus HOWTO at http://www.nltk.org/howto.

p49 10d omit single quotes around pathname (this is meant to be the location, not a string)
    **** NOT DONE FOR IN BOOK FOR /usr/share/dict ****

p50 confirming the cw italic font for metavariables is correct

p52 1,2d omit single quotes from america, Americans and make italic font

p73 q19 "like the one given above for modals"
    -> "like the one given in section 2.1 for modals"
    or "like the one given on p42 for modals"

p75 it would be nice to avoid these widowed lines if possible.
    (removing "different" from q3 would save one line)

p81 Table 3-1 caption: words in quotes s/b unquoted roman.

p83 3d Enter -- set as italic?
    **** NOT DONE IN BOOK ****

p84 Figure 3-1 caption: nltk.Text s/b cw

p89 Figure 3-2 caption: Monty Python s/b unquoted roman

p89 fig 3-2 scale smaller?

p91 in 4th sent of sect 3.3, different fonts seem to be being used for the 4 
glyphs illustrating non-ASCII character sets. E.g. 3rd and 4th look larger and 
seem to be in cw font. Can this be fixed? (Similarly, p 93 13up, p94 15d)

p95 LD query: this is meant to be Python output to a terminal window, so I would
say it s/b cw.

p96 12up "Words corpus" -> "Words Corpus"
    Fig 3-4: should we try to get a higher quality screen shot, without colorization?

p116 18up with conversion -> with a conversion

p120 delete "proc", lowercase "Normalizing"

     ex 28: "MedLine corpus" -> "MedLine Corpus"

     ex 29:  the mathematical expression should formatted as such, not cw

     ex 31: add the following at the start of this exercise
         (where material inside double backticks is set in cw)
      "Define the variable ``saying`` to contain the list
      ``['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done', ',', 'more',
      'is', 'said', 'than', 'done', '.']``.
       Process this list using a ``for`` loop...

p128 Fig 4-1 caption: foo, bar s/b cw (x 2)

p131 20-22d replace semicolon with colon, and delete to the end of the paragraph (28 words)
 
     12up move the tag [1] earlier so it appears straight after "comma operator"

p133 Para starting "Notice in this code sample..." has been displaced.
     It should appear on the previous page, after the code output (29, 5, 2)
     and before the "Your Turn" note.

p135 13up lexicon s/b cw, assignment statement shouldn't be split inside variable name

p140 "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other  languages,
     when Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives."
     -> "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other languages."
     "However, Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives,
     as we have seen."

p144 6up "defensive programming" --- maybe this should be introduced as a new
term here (i.e. set in bold) rather than waiting until p157.

p149 17up permutations s/b cw

p150 6up "keyword arguments" s/b boldface

     ex 25 NLTK's the Shakespeare -> NLTK's Shakespeare

     ex 26 How -> In what way

     ex 27 The equation for Catalan numbers needs to be set as a math equation (i.e.,
     italicized subscripts); similarly for C_n at end of 27(a).

p201 8up n-1: "1" s/b roman
     7up t_n: subscript "n" s/b italic

     Fig 5-5: The labels have gone wrong here. The subscripts should be no bigger in

p202 7up  t_n-1: subscript "n" s/b italic

p209 17up (e.g.,, -> (e.g.,
