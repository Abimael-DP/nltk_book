delete NLTK LDC service paragraph?

It would replace everything from the sentence starting "So let’s add some ..." down to the end of the section (i.e. to just before header 10.4):

So let's add a new assumption which makes the sets of men and women disjoint. The model builder
still produces a countermodel, but this time it is more in accord with our intuitions
about the situation:

   >>> a7 = lp.parse('all x. (man(x) -> -woman(x))')
   >>> g = lp.parse('love(adam,eve)')
   >>> mc = nltk.MaceCommand(g, assumptions=[a4, a5, a6, a7])
   >>> mc.build_model()
   True
   >>> print mc.valuation
   {'C1': 'c',
    'adam': 'a',
    'eve': 'b',
    'love': set([('a', 'c')]),
    'man': set([('a',)]),
    'woman': set([('b',), ('c',)])}

On reflection, we can see that there is nothing in our premises which says that Eve is the only woman in the domain of discourse, so the countermodel in fact is acceptable. If we wanted to rule it out, we would have to add a further assumption such as ``exists y. all x. (woman(x) -> (x = y))`` to ensure that there is only one woman in the model.
