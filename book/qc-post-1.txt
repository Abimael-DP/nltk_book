Fig 1.1 -- more contrast
Fig 1.3 -- smaller scale
Fig 2.7 -- more contrast
Fig 4.3 -- inconsistent arrow style, colliding arrow heads, inconsistent arrow origins
Fig 6.5 -- higher resolution
Fig 6.7 -- larger scale
Fig 9.1 -- smaller scale, fix broken vbars
Fig 10.3 -- fix horizontal alignment (subtrees rooted at greek letter variables)
Fig 11.4 -- missing subscript on s_1

Ch 9: DAGs all scaled too big

Everywhere: All trees should not have boldfaced non-terminals (except
the one on p167), as previously agreed.  (Ch 9 (35) was still
inconsistently boldfaced -- but there should be no boldfacing)

p339 (23) incorrect diagram, as reported during QC2.  It should be: 
  http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch09.html#ex-dag04

p355 -- why is code segment boxed?

p382 (28) -- smaller scale

bad pagebreaks: xiv, 18, 43, 76, 103, 341, 343

p395 8up "core", "store" s/b uc in the SEM value of VP

p467: "deve-test" -> "dev-test"
