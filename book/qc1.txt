p17 fig 1-3 reduce scale of figure

p34 Note that there are three paragraphs but four citations.
    Happy to replace with regular citations and expand bibliography accordingly.

p34 The ACL website is http://www.aclweb.org/

p43 The missing figure citation is to fig 1-2

p44 Happy to omit the second sentence of the table caption

p45 Content of the table looks fine to me; note that since the CoNLL entry is wrapped,
    we might as well expand "Sel" -> "Selections"
    
p46 table 2-3 Delete second occurrence of "nltk.corpus.reader" in table caption.
    It should read: "more documentation can be found using help(nltk.corpus.reader)
    and by reading the online Corpus HOWTO at http://www.nltk.org/howto. 

p50 confirming the slanted font for metavariables is correct

p73 q19 "like the one given above for modals"
    -> "like the one given in section 2.1 for modals"
    or "like the one given on p42 for modals"

p75 it would be nice to avoid these orphaned lines if possible.
    (removing "different" from q3 would save one line)

p89 fig 3-2 scale smaller?

p95 font looks fine to me

p101 "is a loanword" -> "is borrowed from English"

p120 delete "proc", lowercase "Normalizing"

p140 "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other  languages,
     when Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives."
     -> "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other languages."
     "However, Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives,
     as we have seen."

p178 Slanted font for metavariable is correct

*p178 What's the issue with the second highlighted section?

p201 General N-Gram Tagging

p208 Please delete the highlighted material in parentheses

p217 "anti-ngram" -> "anti-n-gram"

p222 ok to make into a paragraph

p223 change reference to corpus in example caption to: Names Corpus

*p231 Edward to advise

p233 "data set" -> "dataset" (at least 7 times in chapter 6)

*p234 Edward to advise
