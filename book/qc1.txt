pxi 5up Chapters -3 -> Chapters 1-3

pxii 2d 8-Chapter 10 -> 8-10
     4d afterword -> Afterword

pxiii [?] Given van Rossum's intro remarks at PyCon 2009, should we also
explicitly say that we are committed to porting NLTK to Python 3.0?

pxiv 13d why is "Graphviz" in bold?

     Table P-2: maxent -> maximum entropy

pxvi data-set -> dataset

pxvii Conventions: URLs should be listed under "Italic", not "Constant width"

pxviii [?] "Using Code Examples" -- needs revising since we already distribute the code
under GPL

pxix [?] If possible, add reference to Edward Clarence Dyason Fellowship

p6 Numpy -> NumPy

p7 5d internet -> Internet

p8 6up called function -> called a function

p17 fig 1-3 reduce scale of figure
    3up careful use -> careful to use

p26 letter "l" -> letter l [italic] (cf p36, ex 24)

p31 13d chap-data-intensive -> Chapter 5

p34 Note that there are three paragraphs but four citations.
    Happy to replace with regular citations and expand bibliography accordingly.

p34 The ACL website is http://www.aclweb.org/

p35 ex 9b: adding it -> adding the string
    ex 10b: b. b) -> b.
    ex 15: letter "b" -> letter b [italic]
    ex 25a with "sh" -> with sh [italic] 

p43 The missing figure citation is to fig 1-2
    9up file[:4] -> fileid[:4]

[?] We're not consistent in the referring to the Inaugural addresses corpus; we
have the following variants:

US Presidential Inaugural Addresses corpus
Inaugural corpus
Inaugural Address Corpus (Table 2-2 and captions for Figure 2-1, Figure 2-3)

Note that we always capitalize corpus in Brown Corpus but not elsewhere -- why?

p44 Happy to omit the second sentence of the table caption
    Fig 2-1 caption: america, citizen s/b roman

[?] Per Ewan: "The 'Contents' column needs to be reviewed by SB."
My concern was that the hyphenation conventions being used here seem unclear.
There are several hyphenated forms that we don't use elsewhere, such as
part-of-speech and named-entity. I don't see the motivation for this. Also, we have
both "part-of-speech tagged" and "POS-tagged".

p45 Content of the table looks fine to me; note that since the CoNLL entry is wrapped,
    we might as well expand "Sel" -> "Selections"

    [?] is "Presidential Addresses"/"Ahrens" correct? Is this meant to be the same as 
    item 39 on http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nltk_data/index.xml?
    
p47 Table 2-3 Delete second occurrence of "nltk.corpus.reader" in table caption.
    It should read: "more documentation can be found using help(nltk.corpus.reader)
    and by reading the online Corpus HOWTO at http://www.nltk.org/howto.

[?]
"Your Turn: Pick a language of interest in udhr.fileids(), and define a
variable raw_text = udhr.raw('Language-Latin1')."

This isn't clear. Presumably 'Language-Latin1' is (in part) a metavariable for the
reader's choice of language. However, we're using italic cw for metavariables, and I
would say that we should also omit the single quotes.

p49 10d [?] omit single quotes -- in context, this is meant to be the location, not a string.

p50 confirming the cw italic font for metavariables is correct

p52 1,2d omit single quotes from america, Americans and make italic font

p53 Ex 2-1 caption: generate_model() s/b cw

p54 [?] File menu, Run menu -- aren't we using cw for these cases?

p58 16up fail -> fails

p59 [?] length constraint -> length constraints

p60 [?] to be consistent, the cited letters (e.g. a, e, i etc) s/b roman 

p67 Fig 2-8 the line joining "motor vehicle" to "go-kart" s/b vertical

p69 11d antonymy s/b bold font

p71 4d [?] function -> method name

    15up insert closing parens after URL

p73 q19 "like the one given above for modals"
    -> "like the one given in section 2.1 for modals"
    or "like the one given on p42 for modals"

p75 it would be nice to avoid these orphaned lines if possible.
    (removing "different" from q3 would save one line)

p81 Table 3-1 caption: words in quotes s/b unquoted roman.

p84 Figure 3-1 caption: nltk.Text s/b cw

p89 Figure 3-2 caption: Monty Python s/b unquoted roman

p89 fig 3-2 scale smaller?

p90 [?] since material on strings vs lists overlaps bottom p84 / top p85,
should we add a line to say that we are reinforcing points made earlier?

p91 in 4th sent of sect 3.3, different fonts seem to be being used for the 4 
glyphs illustrating non-ASCII character sets. E.g. 3rd and 4th look larger and 
seem to be in cw font. Can this be fixed? (Similarly, p 93 13up, p94 15d)

p95 LD query: this is meant to be Python output to a terminal window, so I would
say it s/b cw.

p97 Fig 3-5: numbers are missing from middle row. [?] Also it looks like it could be
reduced slightly.

p97--100 [?] We seem to be being inconsistent in presentation of regex symbols: some of
them are in straight double quotes, a couple (p99, 9d) are in single straight quotes,
and some are not quoted at all. My preference would be for no quotes, or failing
that, double curly quotes.

p101 "is a loanword" -> "is borrowed from English"

p106 [?] it looks as tho the WN lemmatizer doesn't handle any verb forms.

p113 [?] Ex 3-5: should we add a line to the caption explaining Python's backtick
operator? 

p116 18up with conversion -> with a conversion

p119 4up [?] this is the first mention of lexeme

p120 delete "proc", lowercase "Normalizing"
[?] do we need second mention of Mertz and J&M?

p121 [?] should we give an example of an AI text?
     ex 4: can also specify -> can specify
           [?] we haven't given a value for msg

p122 ex 7: increase point size of subparts 7(a), 7(b)
     [?] ex 8: "clear setting out" doesn't sound v idiomatic
     [?] ex 9(b): companies -> organizations

p124 [?] ex 27: "500 randomly chosen letters" -- are these meant to be
drawn from the string "aehh "? It's not clear what is meant by
"normalize the whitespace in this string".

     [?] ex 29:  4.71 μw + 0.5 μs - 21.43 -- should this really be cw?

     [?] ex 31: the variable saying was defined on p118, viz as

     >>> saying = ['After', 'all', 'is', 'said', 'and', 'done', ',',
     ... 'more', 'is', 'said', 'than', 'done', '.']

     Are we expecting readers to pick up on this?

p140 "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other  languages,
     when Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives."
     -> "It is tempting to adopt idioms from other languages."
     "However, Python offers some elegant and highly readable alternatives,
     as we have seen."

p178 Slanted font for metavariable is correct

*p178 What's the issue with the second highlighted section?

p201 General N-Gram Tagging

p208 Please delete the highlighted material in parentheses

p210 lexeme BE -> lexeme be

p217 "anti-ngram" -> "anti-n-gram"

p222 ok to make into a paragraph

p223 change reference to corpus in example caption to: Names Corpus

*p231 Edward to advise

p233 "data set" -> "dataset" (at least 7 times in chapter 6)

*p234 Edward to advise
