    <h2>NLTK: Installing on Unix with SRPMs</h2>

    <p> If you are not using RedHat 7.1, or if you have modified your
    system substantially since you installed it, then the provided
    RPMs may not work.  If they don't, you can try building
    "customized" RPMs from the SRPM:</p>
  
<pre>
    % rpm --rebuild python2-2.1.1-3.src.rpm 
</pre>
  
    <p>WARNING: This may take a while.</p>
  
    <p> This will create new binary RPMs.  On RedHat, these RPMs are
    saved to /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/.  Once you have generated
    these RPMs, follow the RPM instructions (using these new RPMs, not
    the ones on the CD).  If you also need to create binary RPMS from
    the SRPMS for the other packages, you can do so with the following
    commands:</p>
  
<pre>
    % rpm --rebuild Numeric-20.1.0-1.src.rpm
    % rpm --rebuild nltk-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
</pre>
  
    <pre> Note, however, that if an SRPM depends on a package, you may
    need to build the RPMs for that package and install it before you
    can rebuild from your SRPM.</pre>

    <h3> Troubleshooting</h3>
  
    <p> You may not have installed some packages that the SRPM depends
    on.  For example, in my case the package "db1-devel" was not
    installed, so I got the following error message:</p>
  
<pre>
    % rpm --rebuild python2-2.1.1-3.src.rpm 
    Installing python2-2.1.1-3.src.rpm
    error: failed build dependencies:
            db1-devel   is needed by python2-2.1.1-3
</pre>
  
    <p> If you get similar error messages, find the RPMs for the
    missing packages (they are all on the RedHat 7.1 CDs) and install
    them.  If you don't have the RedHat CDs, use rpmfind, or search
    the web.  In my case, db1-devel is provided by a file on the
    second RedHat CD.  I inserted the CD, and installed the RPM: </p>
  
<pre>
    % mount /mnt/cdrom
    % rpm -i /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/db1-devel-1.85-5.i386.rpm 
</pre>

    <p> After you have installed all of the packages that the Python
    SRPM depends on, try the SRPM install instructions again.</p>
  
    <p> The expat-1.1-4tummy.src.rpm SRPM is also provided on the NLTK
    CD.  This can be used if your system does not provide
    expat-devel.</p>
