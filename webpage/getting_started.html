    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    <p> NLTK is a toolkit of <a
    href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> modules.  There are three
    typical ways to use NLTK: </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Run the Python interpreter, and use NLTK
      interactively. </li> 

      <li> Create a Python program that uses NLTK, using a text editor
      (such as Notepad, Emacs, or vi); and execute it (either from the
      command line, or by double-clicking on its icon). </li>

      <li> Use an integrated development enviroment, such as IDLE or
      Emacs' Python Mode. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> How you prefer to interact with Python and NLTK is a personal
    choice.  If you are new to Python, we suggest that you try using
    an integrated development enviroment, such as IDLE.  IDLE is
    included with Python on most systems. </p>

    <h3> Installation </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="windows_install.html">Windows</a></li>
      <li> <a href="unix_install.html">Unix</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Using NLTK </h3>

    <p> NLTK consists of a set of Python <i>modules</i>, each of which
    defines classes and functions related to a single data structure
    or task.  Before you can use a module, you must import its
    contents.  The simplest way to import the contents of a module is
    to use the "<code>from module import *</code>" command. For
    example, to import the contents of the <a
    href="ref/public/nltk.token-module.html"><code>nltk.token</code>
    module</a>, type: </p>

    <pre>
    >>> from nltk.token import *
    </pre>

    <p> For more information on importing modules, and for a general
    introduction to NLTK, see the "<a
    href="tutorial/introduction/t1.html">Basics</a>" tutorial.  Once
    you have worked through the "Basics" tutorials, you may want to
    look at the <a href="tutorial/index.html">other
    tutorials</a>. </p>
 
    <h3> Running IDLE </h3>

    <p> IDLE is an integrated development environment, which simplifies
    the task of creating and debugging Python programs.  On Windows,
    IDLE is located in the start menu ("Programs&#8594;Python&nbsp;2.1&#8594;Idle").
    On unix, you can run IDLE from the command line, with the command
    "<code>idle</code>". </p>

    <p> Within IDLE, you can use the interactive interpreter; or you
    can create a new Python file ("File&#8594;New&nbsp;Window").  To execute the
    new Python file, use "Edit&#8594;Run&nbsp;script" (or Ctrl-F5).  To save the
    new Python file, use "File&#8594;Save" (or Ctrl-S).  When you save your
    Python file, use the extension "<code>.py</code>".  You can open
    an existing Python program with "File&#8594;Open" (or Ctrl-O). </p>
