    <P> The NLP Toolkit is a Python package intended to simplify the
    task of programming natural language systems.  Its primary
    audience is graduate and undergraduate students studying
    computational linguistics.  In particular, it was designed for use
    with the class <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis530">CIS-530</a>
    at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu">University of Pennsylvania</a>. </P>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>

    Several different types of documentation are available, describing
    different aspects of the toolkit.

    <UL>
      <LI> <a href="tutorial/index.html">Tutorials</a> teach students
      how to use the toolkit, in the context of performing specific
      tasks.  They are appropriate for anyone who wishes to learn how
      to use the toolkit. </LI>

      <LI> The toolkit's <a href="ref/nltk.html">reference
      documentation</a> describes every module, interface, class,
      method, function, and variable in the toolkit.  This
      documentation should be useful to both users and
      developers. </LI>

      <LI> A number of <a href="tech/index.html">technical reports</a>
      are available.  These reports explain and justify the toolkit's
      design and implementation.  They are used by the developers of
      the toolkit to guide and document the toolkit's construction.
      Students can consult these reports if they would like further
      information about how the toolkit is designed and why it is
      designed that way. </LI>
    </UL>

    <h3>Problem Sets</h3>

    <P> Sample <a href="psets/index.html">problem sets and
    solutions</a> are available to help you learn to use the toolkit,
    and to give you an idea of the types of things you can use the
    toolkit to do. </P>

    <h3>Download</h3>

    <P> Official releases of the toolkit are available from the 
      <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=30982">
      SourceForge download page</a>. </P>
    
    <h3>Current Status</h3>

    <P> See the <a href="timetable.html">timetable</a> or the
    SourceForge <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pm/?group_id=30982">
    tasklist</a> for more information about the current status of the
    toolkit. (n.b.: this is not currently up-to-date) </P>
