* Known bugs/issues with NLTK
*

This file lists a variety of known problems with the toolkit; and
aspects of the toolkit that we intend to change (but not new
features/modules that we intend to add).  If you encounter any
problems that are not covered here, please email me at
<edloper@gradient.cis.upenn.edu>.

Highest Priority
================
  - consistant interface for multiple return values
  - change ChunkParserI to inerhit from ParserI
  - rewrite parsing tutorials

Complete list
=============
  Bugs
  ~~~~
    - "dash" and "state" options don't seem to be supported by Tkinter
       on some systems (SunOS?).  Just not using "dash" wouldn't be
       too bad, but we do make use of hidden/normal state for tree
       canvas widgets.
  
  Pending design changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - change ChunkParserI to inherit from ParserI (so it will return
      TreeTokens, not lists)
    - enforce consistant interfaces for returning multiple possible
      values (parse_n, etc.)
  
  Pending tutorial changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - probability: still need to describe ProbDistI & subclasses, and
      ConditionalProbDist
    - writing classes: merge this with intro, resulting in 2
      tutorials: a basics/intro one, and one that looks at tokenizers
      in more detail, and introduces the concepts behind OOP, etc.
    - parsing: rewrite, & split into 2 tutorials: basic parsing and
      chart parsing
    - chunk parsing: once we change ChartParserI to be a type of
      parser, the tutorial will need to be updated
    - classifying: naive bayes stuff could stand to be cleaned up
    - probabilistic parsing: talk about different kinds of bottom-up
      chart parser? 
    - regular expression tutorial still needs some work
  
  Pending code changes
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - make type checking ubiquitous/consistant
  
  Code that needs to be cleaned up
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - nltk.draw.chart: update to use the new canvas widget system
    - nltk.draw.plot: we need a better plot system.  Use PMW/BLT?
    - nltk.naivebayes: general clean up
    - nltk.fsa: clean up, use better parser?
  
  Unit testing
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - fix/check the unit testing that's currently installed; and add
      unit testing for more modules.
  
  Technical documents that need to be written
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - multivalue: describe interface for multiple return values
    - conventions: a single place to list conventions about naming
      variables, using interfaces, how to handle trace output,
      etc...
