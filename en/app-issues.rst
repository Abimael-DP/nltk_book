=====================================
Appendix: Known Issues with this Book
=====================================

--------------
General Issues
--------------

* The further reading sections of each chapter are patchy; some are comprehensive while
  some are minimal.  We intend to make these consistent, providing a representative
  set of pointers to other materials.

* It is difficult for readers to know which exercises at the end of the chapter
  correspond to which sections of the chapter.

* The diagrams of the book need to be set in grayscale and high-resolution, for the
  hardcopy version.

-------------------------------------
Chapter-Specific Issues and Questions
-------------------------------------

* ch06: the structure of this chapter is still in flux; suggestions for
  improving the structure and prioritizing the content welcomed

* ch07: we are hoping to get some English named-entity data so that we
  can illustrate how to train a named entity classifier

* ch10: we don't have permission to use this photograph

* ch12: the final chapter is incomplete; it will consist of free-standing
  sections on further topics, giving readers a sense of the breadth of
  the field and the interesting challenges still faced
