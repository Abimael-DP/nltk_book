=====================================
Appendix: Known Issues with this Book
=====================================

--------------
General Issues
--------------

* The further reading sections of each chapter are patchy; some are comprehensive while
  some are minimal.  We intend to make these consistent, providing a representative
  set of pointers to other materials.

* The diagrams of the book need to be set in grayscale and high-resolution, for the
  hardcopy version.

Chapter-Specific Issues and Questions
-------------------------------------

* ch07: we are hoping to get some English named-entity data so that we
  can illustrate how to train a named entity classifier
