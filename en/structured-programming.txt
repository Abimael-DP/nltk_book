===================================
6. Structured Programming in Python
===================================

------------
Introduction
------------

In Part I you had an intensive introduction to Python (Chapter chap-programming_)
followed by chapters on words, tags, and chunks (Chapters chap-words_\ -\ chap-chunk_).
These chapters contain may examples and exercises
that should have helped you consolidate your Python skills
and apply them to simple NLP tasks.  So far our programs |mdash| and the data we have have
been processing |mdash| have been relatively unstructured.
In Part II we will focus on `structure`:em:\ : i.e. structured programming
with structured data.

In this chapter we will review key programming concepts and explain
many of the minor points that could easily trip you up.  More fundamentally,
we will introduce important concepts in structured programming that
help you write readable, well-organized programs that you and others will
be able to re-use.
As before, this chapter contains many examples and
exercises.  Readers new to programming should work through them carefully;
while experienced programmers should quickly skim this chapter.

------------------
Back to the Basics
------------------

Let's begin by revisiting some of the fundamental operations and data structures
required for natural language processing in Python.  It is important to appreciate
several finer points in order to write correct, idiomatic Python programs.
We'll start with the most innocuous operation of all: `assignment`:em:.
Then we will look at sequence types in detail.

.. _sec-assignment:

Assignment
----------

Python's assignment statement operates on `values`:em:.  But what is a value?
Consider the following code fragment:

    >>> word1 = 'Monty'
    >>> word2 = word1              # [_assignment1]
    >>> word1 = 'Python'           # [_assignment2]
    >>> word2
    'Monty'
    
This code shows that when we write ``word2 = word1`` in line assignment1_,
the value of ``word1`` (the string ``'Monty'``) is assigned to ``word2``.
This makes a copy, and when we overwrite
``word1`` with a new string ``'Python'`` in line assignment2_, the value
of ``word2`` is not affected.

An important subtlety of Python is that the "value" of a structured object
(such as a list) is actually a `reference`:em: to the object.  In the
following example, line assignment3_
assigns the reference of ``words1`` to the new variable ``words2``.
When we modify something inside ``words1`` on line assignment4_, we can see
that the contents of ``words2`` has also been changed.

    >>> words1 = ['Monty', 'Python']
    >>> words2 = words1            # [_assignment3]
    >>> words1[1] = 'Bodkin'       # [_assignment4]
    >>> words2
    ['Monty', 'Bodkin']

|nopar|    
Thus line assignment3_ does not copy the contents of the
variable, only its "object reference".
To understand what is going on here, we need to
know how lists are stored in the computer's memory.
In Figure array-memory_, we see that a list ``sent1`` is
a reference to an object stored at location 3133 (which is
itself a series of pointers to other locations holding strings).
When we assign ``sent2 = sent1``, it is just the object reference
3133 that gets copied.

   List Assignment and Computer Memory

Sequences: Strings, Lists and Tuples
------------------------------------

We have seen three kinds of sequence object: strings, lists, and tuples.
As sequences they have some common properties: they can be indexed and they have
a length:

    >>> string = 'I turned off the spectroroute'
    >>> words = ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']
    >>> pair = (6, 'turned')
    >>> string[2], words[3], pair[1]
    ('t', 'the', 'turned')
    >>> len(string), len(words), len(pair)
    (29, 5, 2)

|nopar|
We can iterate over the items in a sequence ``s`` in a variety of useful ways,
as shown in the following table.  The sequence functions can be combined
in various ways, e.g. ``reversed(sorted(set(s)))``.

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Python Expression              | Comment                                     |
+================================+=============================================+
| ``for item in s``              | iterate over the items of ``s``             |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``for item in sorted(s)``      | iterate over the items of ``s`` in order    |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``for item in set(s)``         | iterate over unique elements ``s``          |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``for item in reversed(s)``    | iterate over elements ``s`` in reverse      |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

We can convert between these sequence types.  For example,
``tuple(s)`` converts any kind of sequence into a tuple, and
``list(s)`` converts any kind of sequence into a list.
We can convert a list of strings to a single string using the
``join`` function, e.g. ``':'.join(words)``.

Notice in the above code sample that we computed multiple values
on a single line, separated by commas.  These comma-separated
expressions are actually just tuples.  We use tuples to spontaneously
aggregate items.  In the next example we use tuples to re-arrange the
contents of our list:

    >>> words[2], words[3], words[4] = words[3], words[4], words[2]
    >>> words    
    ['I', 'turned', 'the', 'spectroroute', 'off']

|nopar|
This is an idiomatic and readable way to move items inside a list.
It is equivalent to the following traditional way of doing such
tasks that does not use tuples (notice that this method needs a
temporary variable ``tmp``).

    >>> tmp = words[2]
    >>> words[2] = words[3]
    >>> words[3] = words[4]
    >>> words[4] = tmp

Observe that Python is usually able to detect the presence of a tuple simply by
seeing a comma; in such cases the parentheses are optional.
The tuple assignment statement in the previous
example does not contain parentheses
(because comma has higher `precedence`:dt: than assignment).
However, when we print a tuple, the parentheses are always displayed.

As we have seen, Python has sequence functions such as ``sorted()`` and ``reversed()``
which rearrange the items of a sequence.  There are also functions that
manipulate the `structure`:em: of a sequence.  The functions ``zip()`` and ``enumerate()``
are particularly useful for language processing.

    >>> words = ['I', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'spectroroute']
    >>> tags = ['nnp', 'vbd', 'in', 'dt', 'nn']
    >>> zip(words, tags)
    [('I', 'nnp'), ('turned', 'vbd'), ('off', 'in'), ('the', 'dt'), ('spectroroute', 'nn')]
    >>> list(enumerate(words))
    [(0, 'I'), (1, 'turned'), (2, 'off'), (3, 'the'), (4, 'spectroroute')]

Combining different sequence types
----------------------------------

Let's combine our knowledge of these three sequence types, together with list
comprehensions, to perform the task of sorting the words in a string by
their length.

    >>> words = 'I turned off the spectroroute'.split()     # [_sequence1]
    >>> wordlens = [(len(word), word) for word in words]    # [_sequence2]
    >>> wordlens.sort()                                     # [_sequence3]
    >>> ' '.join(word for count, word in wordlens)          # [_sequence4]
    'I off the turned spectroroute'

Each of the above lines of code contains a significant feature.
Line sequence1_ demonstrates that a simple string is actually
an object with methods defined on it, such as ``split()``.
Line sequence2_ shows the construction of a list of tuples,
where each tuple consists of a number (the word length) and the
word, e.g. ``(3, 'the')``.  Line sequence3_ sorts the list,
modifying the list in-place.  Finally, line sequence4_ discards
the length information then joins the words back into a single string.
    
We began by talking about the commonalities in these sequence types,
but the above code illustrates important differences in their
roles.  First, strings appear at the beginning and the end: this is
typical in the context where our program is reading in some text and
producing output for us to read.  Lists and tuples are used in the
middle, but for different purposes.  A list is typically a sequence of
objects all having the *same type*, of *arbitrary length*.  We often
use lists to hold sequences of words.  In contrast,
a tuple is typically a collection of objects of *different types*, of
*fixed length*.  We often use a tuple to hold a `record`:dt:,
a collection of different `fields`:dt: relating to some entity.
This distinction between the use of lists and tuples is a bit subtle,
so here is another example:

    >>> lexicon = [
    ...     ('the', 'DT', ['Di:', 'D@']),
    ...     ('off', 'IN', ['Qf', 'O:f'])
    ... ]

|nopar|
Here, a lexicon is represented as a list because it is a collection of objects
of a single type |mdash| lexical entries |mdash| of no predetermined
length.  An individual entry is represented as a tuple because it is
a collection of objects with different interpretations, such as
the orthographic form, the part of speech, and the pronunciations
represented in the SAMPA system.
Note that these pronunciations are stored using a list (why?).

The distinction between lists and tuples has been described in terms of
usage.  However, there is a more fundamental difference: in Python,
lists are `mutable`:dt:, while tuples are `immutable`:dt:.  In other
words, lists can be modified, while tuples cannot.  Here are some of
the operations on lists which do in-place modification of the list.
None of these operations is permitted on a tuple, a fact you should
confirm for yourself.

    >>> lexicon.sort()
    >>> lexicon[1] = ('turned', 'VBD', ['t3:nd', 't3`nd'])
    >>> del lexicon[0]


More List Comprehensions
------------------------

List comprehensions are a convenient and readable way to express
list operations in Python, and they have a wide range of uses in natural language
processing.  In this section we will see some more examples.
The first example takes successive overlapping slices of size
``n`` (a `sliding window`:dt:) from a list
(pay particular attention to the range of the variable ``i``).

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> n = 3
    >>> [sent[i:i+n] for i in range(len(sent)-n+1)]
    [['The', 'dog', 'gave'],
     ['dog', 'gave', 'John'],
     ['gave', 'John', 'the'],
     ['John', 'the', 'newspaper']]

You can also use list comprehensions for a kind of multiplication.
Here we generate all combinations of two determiners, two adjectives, and two nouns.
The list comprehension is split across three lines for readability.

    >>> [(dt,jj,nn) for dt in ('two', 'three')
    ...             for jj in ('old', 'blind')
    ...             for nn in ('men', 'mice')]
    [('two', 'old', 'men'), ('two', 'old', 'mice'), ('two', 'blind', 'men'),
     ('two', 'blind', 'mice'), ('three', 'old', 'men'), ('three', 'old', 'mice'),
     ('three', 'blind', 'men'), ('three', 'blind', 'mice')]

|nopar|
The above example contains three independent ``for`` loops.
These loops have no variables in common, and we could have put them in any order.
We can also have `nested loops`:dt: with shared variables.
The next example iterates over all sentences in a
section of the Brown Corpus, and for each sentence, iterates over each word.

    >>> from nltk_lite.corpora import brown
    >>> [word for sent in brown.raw('a')
    ...     for word in sent
    ...     if len(word) == 17]
    ['September-October', 'Sheraton-Biltmore', 'anti-organization',
     'anti-organization', 'Washington-Oregon', 'York-Pennsylvania',
     'misunderstandings', 'Sheraton-Biltmore', 'neo-stagnationist',
     'cross-examination', 'bronzy-green-gold', 'Oh-the-pain-of-it',
     'Secretary-General', 'Secretary-General', 'textile-importing',
     'textile-exporting', 'textile-producing', 'textile-producing']

Another way to use loop variables is to ignore them!  This is
the standard method to build multidimensional structures.
For example, to build an array with *m* rows and *n* columns,
where each cell is a set, we would use a nested list comprehension,
as shown in line 2d-array_ below.  Observe that the loop variables
``i`` and ``j`` are not used anywhere.

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> m, n = 3, 7
    >>> array = [[set() for i in range(n)] for j in range(m)]     # [_2d-array]
    >>> array[2][5].add('foo')
    >>> pprint(array)
    [[set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])],
     [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([])],
     [set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set([]), set(['foo']), set([])]]

Sometimes we use a list comprehension as part of a larger aggregation task.
In the following example we calculate the average length of words in part of the Brown Corpus.
Notice that we don't bother storing the list comprehension in a temporary
variable, but use it directly as an argument to the ``average()`` function.

    >>> from numpy import average
    >>> average([len(word) for sent in brown.raw('a') for word in sent])
    4.40154543827

Now that we have reviewed the sequence types, we have one more fundamental data type
to revisit.

Dictionaries
------------

As you have already seen, the dictionary data type can be used in a variety
of language processing tasks (e.g. Section getting-organized_).
However, we have only scratched the surface.
Dictionaries have many more applications than you might have imagined.

.. note:: The dictionary data type is often known by the name
   `associative array`:dt:.  A normal array maps from integers (the keys)
   to arbitrary data types (the values), while an associative array places
   no such constraint on keys.  Keys can be strings, tuples, or other
   more deeply nested structure.  Python places the constraint that
   keys must be `immutable`:idx:.

Let's begin by comparing dictionaries with tuples.  Tuples allow
`access by position`:em:; to access the part-of-speech of the following
lexical entry we just have to know it is found at index position ``1``.
However, dictionaries allow `access by name`:em:\ :

    >>> entry_tuple = ('turned', 'VBD', ['t3:nd', 't3`nd'])
    >>> entry_tuple[1]
    'VBD'
    >>> entry_dict = {'lexeme':'turned', 'pos':'VBD', 'pron':['t3:nd', 't3`nd']}
    >>> entry_dict['pos']
    'VBD'

In this case, dictionaries are little more than a convenience.  We can
even simulate access by name using well-chosen constants, e.g.:

    >>> LEXEME = 0; POS = 1; PRON = 2
    >>> entry_tuple[POS]
    'VBD'

This method works when there is a closed set of keys and the keys are known
in advance.  Dictionaries come into their own when we are mapping from
an open set of keys, which happens when the keys are an unrestricted
vocabulary or where they have internal structure.  Listing mystery_
illustrates the first of these.  The function ``mystery()``
begins by initializing a dictionary called ``groups``, then populates it
with words.  We leave it as an exercise for the reader to work out what
this function computes.  For now, its enough to note that the keys of
this dictionary are an open set, and it would not be feasible to use
a integer keys, as would be required if we used lists or tuples for the
representation.

.. pylisting:: mystery

    from nltk_lite.corpora import words
    from string import join
    def mystery():
        groups = {}
        for word in words.raw():
            key = join(sorted(list(word)), '')
            if key not in groups:
                groups[key] = set()
            groups[key].add(word)
        return sorted(join(sorted(v)) for v in groups.values() if len(v) > 1)

The second important use of dictionaries is for mappings that involve structured
keys.

.. pylisting:: structured-keys

    from nltk_lite.corpora import ppattach
    attachment = {}
    prepositions = set()
    N, V = 0, 1
    for entry in ppattach.dictionary('training'):
        prep = entry['prep']
        verb = entry['verb']
        prepositions.add(prep)
        key = verb, prep
        if key not in attachment:
            attachment[key] = [0,0]
        if entry['attachment'] == 'N':
            attachment[key][N] += 1
        else:
            attachment[key][V] += 1
    prep_list = sorted(prepositions)

    >>> for verb in ['bought', 'paid', 'sold', 'took', 'acquired']:
    ...     print verb + ':',
    ...     for prep in sorted(prepositions):
    ...         key = verb, prep
    ...         if key in attachment:
    ...             print prep, `attachment[key][N]` + '/' + `attachment[key][V]`,
    ...     print
    bought: as 0/2 at 0/2 for 1/7 from 1/8 in 11/11 of 19/0 on 0/1 to 1/0
    paid: after 1/0 at 0/1 for 3/14 from 0/1 in 5/5 of 10/0 on 0/2 through 0/1 to 2/8
    sold: as 0/1 at 0/5 for 0/10 from 0/1 in 17/10 into 0/1 of 25/1 on 1/4 than 1/0 to 0/29
    took: after 0/2 against 1/1 amid 0/1 as 0/7 at 1/4 before 0/1 between 0/1 by 0/1 for 2/2 from 2/7 in 4/16 into 0/1 of 22/0 off 0/1 on 3/2 to 1/7 toward 1/0 with 2/2
    acquired: as 1/0 at 0/1 before 0/1 by 0/2 for 0/7 from 0/4 in 5/9 of 11/0 outside 0/1 to 1/0 

* shared values between multiple dictionaries (advanced programming?)

* catching exceptions (dictionary addition)
* compound keys (use tuples not concatenated strings)

* dictionaries with multiple values for a given key (use set or list values)
* dictionary of sets (Shakespeare corpus)

* indexing and space-time trade-offs (more efficient concordancing)
* persistent storage (shelve)

Exercises
---------

#. |easy| Find out more about sequence objects using Python's help facility.
   In the interpreter, type ``help(str)``, ``help(list)``, and ``help(tuple)``.
   This will give you a full list of the functions supported by each type.
   Some functions have special names flanked with underscore; as the
   help documentation shows, each such function corresponds to something
   more familiar.  For example ``x.__getitem__(y)`` is just a long-winded
   way of saying ``x[y]``.

#. |easy| Identify three operations that can be performed on both tuples
   and lists.  Identify three list operations that cannot be performed on
   tuples.  Name a context where using a list instead of a tuple generates
   a Python error.

#. |easy| Find out how to create a tuple consisting of a single item.
   There are at least two ways to do this.

#. |easy| Create a list ``words = ['is', 'NLP', 'fun', '?']``.  Use
   a series of assignment statements (e.g. ``words[1] = words[2]``)
   and a temporary variable ``tmp`` to transform this list into the
   list ``['NLP', 'is', 'fun', '!']``.  Now do the same transformation
   using tuple assignment.

#. |soso| Create a list of words and store it in a variable ``sent1``.

   and verify that ``sent2`` has changed.
   
   a) Now try the same exercise but instead assign ``sent2 = sent1[:]``.
      Modify ``sent1`` again and see what happens to ``sent2``.  Explain.
   b) Now define ``text1`` to be a list of lists of strings (e.g. to
      represent a text consisting of multiple sentences.  Now assign
      ``text2 = text1[:]``, assign a new value to one of the words,
      e.g. ``text1[1][1] = 'Monty'``.  Check what this did to ``text2``.
      Explain.

      consult its documentation, and test that it makes a fresh copy of any
      object.

#. |soso| Write code that takes a list of words (containing duplicates) and
   returns a list of words (with no duplicates) sorted by decreasing frequency.
   E.g. if the input list contained 10 instances of the word ``table`` and 9 instances
   of the word ``chair``, then ``table`` would appear before ``chair`` in the output
   list.
   
#. |soso| Initialize an n-by-m list of lists of empty strings using list

------------------
Presenting Results
------------------

Often we write a program to report a single datum, such as a particular element
in a corpus that meets some complicated criterion, or a single summary statistic
such as a word-count or the performance of a tagger.  More often, we write a program
to produce a structured result, such as a tabulation of numbers or linguistic forms,
or a reformatting of the original data.  When the results to be presented are linguistic,
textual output is usually the most natural choice.  However, when the results are numerical,
it may be preferrable to produce graphical output.  In this section you will learn about
a variety of ways to present program output.

Strings and Formats
-------------------

We have seen that there are two ways to display the contents of an object:

    >>> word = 'cat'
    >>> print word
    cat
    >>> word
    'cat'

The first of these is Python's attempt to produce the most human-readable form of an object.
The second method |mdash| naming the variable at a prompt |mdash| shows us a string
that can be used to recreate this object.  It is important to keep in mind that both of
these are just strings, displayed for the benefit of you, the user.  They do not give
us any clue as to the actual internal representation of the object.

There are many other useful ways to display an object as a string of
characters.  This may be for the benefit of a human reader, or because
we want to `export`:dt: our data to a particular file format for use
in an external program.

Formatted output typically contains a combination of variables and
pre-specified strings, e.g. given a dictionary ``wordcount``
consisting of words and their frequencies we could do:

    >>> wordcount = {'cat':3, 'dog':4, 'snake':1}
    >>> for word in wordcount:
    ...     print word, '->', wordcount[word], ';',
    dog -> 4 ; cat -> 3 ; snake -> 1

Apart from the problem of unwanted whitespace, such print statements
alternating variables and constants can be difficult to read and
maintain.  Instead:

    >>> for word in wordcount:
    ...    print '%s->%d;' % (word, wordcount[word]),
    dog->4; cat->3; snake->1
    
Lining things up
----------------

So far our formatting strings have contained specifications of fixed width, such
as ``%6s``, a string that is padded to width 6 and right-justified.
We can include a minus sign to make it left-justified.
In case we don't know in advance how wide a displayed value should be,
the width value can be replaced with a star in the formatting string,
then specified using a variable.

    >>> '%6s' % 'dog'
    '   dog'
    >>> '%-6s' % 'dog'
    'dog   '
    >>> width = 6
    >>> '%-*s' % (width, 'dog')
    'dog   '

An important use of formatting strings is for tabulating data.
The program in Listing modal-tabulate_ iterates over five genres of the Brown Corpus.
For each token having the ``md`` tag we increment a count.  To do this we
have used ``ConditionalFreqDist()``, where the condition is the current genre
and the event is the modal, i.e. this constructs a frequency distribution of
the modal verbs in each genre.
Line modals-of-interest_
identifies a small set of modals of interest, and calls
the function ``tabulate()`` which
processes the data structure to output the required counts.
Note that we have been careful to separate the language processing
from the tabulation of results.

.. pylisting:: modal-tabulate
   :caption: Frequency of Modals in Different Sections of the Brown Corpus

    from nltk_lite.probability import ConditionalFreqDist
    def count_words_by_tag(t, genres):
        cfdist = ConditionalFreqDist()
        for genre in genres:                       # each genre
            for sent in brown.tagged(genre):       # each sentence
                for (word,tag) in sent:            # each tagged token
                    if tag == t:                   # found a word tagged t
                         cfdist[genre].inc(word.lower())
        return cfdist

    def tabulate(cfdist, words):
        print '%-18s' % 'Genre', ' '.join([('%6s' % w) for w in words])

    >>> genres = ['a', 'd', 'e', 'h', 'n']
    >>> cfdist = count_words_by_tag('md', genres)
    >>> modals = ['can', 'could', 'may', 'might', 'must', 'will']   # [_modals-of-interest]
    >>> tabulate(cfdist, modals)

    fiction: adventure     48    154      6     58     27     48

There are some interesting patterns in the table produced by
Listing modal-tabulate_.  For instance,
compare the rows for government literature and adventure literature;
the former is dominated by the use of ``can, may, must, will`` while
the latter is characterised by the use of ``could`` and ``might``.
With some further work it might be possible to guess the genre of a
new text automatically, according to its distribution of modals.

Our next example, in Listing concordance_, generates a concordance display.
We use the left/right justification of strings and the variable width
to get vertical alignment of a variable-width window.

   brown.raw() behaved like other raw() methods and generated words not lists

Graphical Presentation
----------------------

So far we have focussed on textual presentation and the use of formatted print
statements to get output lined up in columns.  It is often very useful to display
numerical data in graphical form, since this often makes it easier to detect
patterns.  For example, in Listing modal-tabulate_ we saw a table of numbers
showing the frequency of particular modal verbs in the Brown Corpus, classified
by genre.  In Listing modal-plot_ we present the same information in graphical
format.  The output is shown in Figure modal_genre_ (a color figure in the online version).

.. Note:: Listing modal-plot_ uses the PyLab package which supports sophisticated
   plotting functions with a MATLAB-style interface.  For more information about
   this package please see ``http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/``.

---------------------
Functions and Modules
---------------------

Once you have been programming for a while, you will find that you need
to perform a task that you have done in the past.  In fact, over time,
the number of completely novel things you have to do in creating a program
decreases significantly.  Half of the work may involve simple tasks that
you have done before.  Thus it is important for your code to be `re-usable`:em:.
One effective way to do this is to abstract commonly used sequences of steps
into a `function`:dt:.

For example, suppose we find that we often want to read text from an HTML file.
This involves several steps: opening the file, reading it in, normalizing
whitespace, and stripping HTML markup.  We can collect these steps into a
function, and give it a name such as ``get_text()``:

    >>> import re
    >>> def get_text(file):
    ...     "Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace and stripping HTML markup"
    ...     text = open(file).read()
    ...     text = re.sub('\s+', ' ', text)
    ...     text = re.sub(r'<.*?>', ' ', text)
    ...     return text

Now, any time we want to get cleaned-up text from an HTML file, we can just call
``get_text()`` with the name of the file as its only argument.  It will return
a string, and we can assign this to a variable, e.g.:
``contents = get_text("test.html")``.  Each time we want to use this series of
steps we only have to call the function.

Using functions has the benefit of saving space in our program.  More
importantly, our choice of name for the function helps make the program *readable*.
In the case of the above example, whenever our program needs to read cleaned-up
text from a file we don't have to clutter the program with four lines of code, we
simply need to call ``get_text()``.  This naming helps to provide some "semantic
interpretation" |mdash| it helps a reader of our program to see what the program "means".

Notice that the above function definition contains a string.  The first string inside
a function definition is called a `docstring`:dt:.  Not only does it document the
purpose of the function to someone reading the code, it is accessible to a programmer
who has loaded the code from a file:

    >>> help(get_text)
    get_text(file)
        Read text from a file, normalizing whitespace and stripping HTML markup

We have seen that functions help to make our work reusable and readable.  They
also help make it *reliable*.  When we re-use code that has already been developed
and tested, we can be more confident that it handles a variety of cases correctly.
We also remove the risk that we forget some important step, or introduce a bug.
The program which calls our function also has increased reliability.  The author
of that program is dealing with a shorter program, and its components have a
transparent semantics.

Checking Arguments
------------------

* defensive programming
* assert
* raising errors

Return Values
-------------

* return
* need for consistent type
* avoid deeply nested returns
* using tuples:

Another common way to use tuples is in the return values of functions,
in those situations where we want to return multiple items of
different types.  Here we define a function that returns a tuple
consisting of the average word length of a sentence, and the inventory
of letters used in the sentence.

    >>> def proc_words(words):
    ...     avg_wordlen = sum(len(word) for word in words)/len(words)
    ...     chars_used = ''.join(sorted(set(''.join(words))))
    ...     return avg_wordlen, chars_used
    >>> proc_words(words)
    (5, 'Icdefhnoprstu')
    
* this sort of thing is seldom a good idea!

* when to modify a parameter vs return a value
* related issue with side-effects:

    >>> def my_sort(l):
    ...     l.sort()
    ...     return l
    >>> a = [2, 1]
    >>> b = my_sort(a)
    >>> b
    [1, 2]
    >>> a
    [1, 2]

[Function was misleading...]


An Important Subtlety
---------------------

Back in Section sec-assignment_ you saw that in Python, assignment works on values,
but that the value of a structured object is a reference to that object.  The same
is true for functions.  Python interprets function parameters as values (this is
known as `call-by-value`:dt:).  Consider the following function; it has two parameters,
both of which are modified inside the function.  We begin by assigning an empty string
to ``w`` and an empty dictionary to ``p``.  After calling the function, ``w`` is unchanged,
while ``p`` is changed:

    >>> def set_up(word, properties):
    ...     word = 'cat'
    ...     properties['pos'] = 'noun'
    >>> w = ''
    >>> p = {}
    >>> set_up(w, p)
    >>> w
    ''
    >>> p
    {'pos': 'noun'}
    
To understand why ``w`` was not changed, it is necessary to understand call-by-value.
When we called ``set_up(w, p)``, the value of ``w`` (an empty string) was assigned to
a new local variable ``word``.  Inside the function, the value of ``word`` was modified.
However, that had no affect on the external value of ``w``.  This parameter passing is
identical to the following sequence of assignments:

    >>> w = ''
    >>> word = w
    >>> word = 'cat'
    >>> w
    ''
 
Now, in the case of the structured object, matters are quite different.
When we called ``set_up(w, p)``, the value of ``p`` (an empty
dictionary) was assigned to a new local variable ``properties``.  Since the
value of ``p`` was an object reference, both variables reference the same
memory location.  Modifying something inside ``properties`` will also
change ``p``, just as if we had done the following sequence of assignments:
 
    >>> p = {}
    >>> properties = p
    >>> properties['pos'] = 'noun'
    >>> p
    {'pos': 'noun'}

Passing a Function as an Argument
---------------------------------

So far the arguments we have passed into functions have been simple objects like
strings, or structured objects like lists.  These arguments allow us to parameterise
the behavior of a function.  As a result, functions are very flexible and powerful
abstractions, permitting us to repeatedly apply the `same operation`:em: on `different data`:em:.
Python also lets us pass a function as
an argument to another function.  Now we can abstract out the operation, and apply
a `different operation`:em: on the `same data`:em:.  As the following examples show,
we can pass the built-in function ``len()`` or a user-defined function ``last_letter()``
as parameters to another function:

    >>> def extract_property(prop):
    ...     words = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    ...     return [prop(word) for word in words]
    >>> extract_property(len)
    [3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 9]
    >>> def last_letter(word):
    ...     return word[-1]
    >>> extract_property(last_letter)
    ['e', 'g', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'r']
    
Surprisingly, ``len`` and ``last_letter`` are objects that can be
passed around like lists and dictionaries.  Notice that parentheses
are only used after a function name if we are invoking the function;
when we are simply passing the function around as an object these are
not used.

Python provides us with one more way to define functions as arguments
to other functions, so-called `lambda expressions`:dt:.  Supposing there
was no need to use the above ``last_letter()`` function in multiple places,
we can equivalently write the following:
    
    >>> extract_property(lambda w: w[-1])
    ['e', 'g', 'e', 'n', 'e', 'r']
    
Here is an example of passing a function to the list sort method.
When we call ``sorted()`` with a single argument (the list to be sorted),
it uses the built-in lexicographic comparison function ``cmp()``.
However, we can supply our own sort function, e.g. to sort by decreasing
length.

    >>> words = 'I turned off the spectroroute'.split()
    >>> sorted(words)
    ['I', 'off', 'spectroroute', 'the', 'turned']
    >>> sorted(words, cmp)
    ['I', 'off', 'spectroroute', 'the', 'turned']
    >>> sorted(words, lambda x, y: cmp(len(y), len(x)))
    ['spectroroute', 'turned', 'off', 'the', 'I']

Earlier we saw an example of filtering out some items in a list comprehension.
Thus we can restrict the list to just the lexical words, using
``[word for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]``.  This is a little cumbersome
as it mentions the ``word`` variable three times.  A more compact way to say
the same thing is as follows:

    >>> def is_lexical(word):
    ...     return word.lower() not in ('a', 'an', 'the', 'that', 'to')
    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> filter(is_lexical, sent)
    ['dog', 'gave', 'John', 'newspaper']

|nopar|
Here we have used the function itself as an argument.  Functions are ultimately
just another kind of object that can be passed around a program.  The ``filter()``
function applies its first argument (a function) to its second (a sequence),
applying the function to each item in turn, only passing it through if the function
returns true for that item.  Thus ``filter(f, seq)`` is equivalent to
``[item for item in seq if apply(f,item) == True]``.
    
Python provides some other helpful functions like ``filter()``.  Here is a simple
way to find the average length of a sentence in a section of the Brown Corpus:

    >>> average(map(len, brown.raw('a')))
    21.7461072664

|nopar|
This code applies the function (in this case ``len()``) to each item in the
sequence, and builds a new sequence containing the results.

Above we used the ``map()`` function to apply ``len()`` to
each item in a sequence.  Instead of ``len()``, we could have passed in any
other function we liked:

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> def is_vowel(letter):
    ...     return letter in "AEIOUaeiou"
    >>> def vowelcount(word):
    ...     return len(filter(is_vowel, word))
    >>> map(vowelcount, sent)
    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3]

|nopar|
Instead of using filter to call a named function ``is_vowel``, we can
define a lambda expression as follows:

    >>> map(lambda w: len(filter(lambda c: c in "AEIOUaeiou", w)), sent)
    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3]

Functional Decomposition (notes)
--------------------------------

Well-structured programs often make extensive use of functions.  Often
when a block of program code grows longer than 10-20 lines, it is a
great help to readability if it is decomposed into one or more
functions.

This is analogous to a paragraph in essay writing: one main idea; split up
overlong paragraphs; somewhat arbitrary.

* Functions as an opportunity to associate a name with functionality
* Abstraction
* Motivations: maintainability, correctness
* We can reimplement a function while maintaining the same behavior (hiding)
* Main program can be written at a higher level, making its structure transparent, e.g.

    >>> def main():
    ...     data = load_corpus()
    ...     results = analyze(data)
    ...     present(results)

* corresponds to block structure (diagram)


Example -- function does two tasks: creates freqdist and returns list.
Function should do one thing only.

    >>> def freq_words(file, freqdist, n):
    ...     text = open(file).read()
    ...     for word in text.split():
    ...         freqdist.inc(word)
    ...     return freqdist.sorted_samples()[:n]

Recursion
---------

We first saw recursion in Chapter chap-words_, in a function that navigated
the hypernym hierarchy of WordNet...

Iterative solution:

    >>> def factorial(n):
    ...     result = 1
    ...     for i in range(n+1):
    ...         result *= i
    ...     return result

Recursive solution (base case, induction step)

    >>> def factorial(n):
    ...     if n == 1:
    ...         return n
    ...     else:
    ...         return n * factorial(n-1)

Generating all permutations of words, to check which ones are
grammatical:

    >>> def perms(seq):
    ...     if len(seq) <= 1:
    ...         yield seq
    ...     else:
    ...         for perm in perms(seq[1:]):
    ...             for i in range(len(perm)+1):
    ...                 yield perm[:i] + seq[0:1] + perm[i:]
    >>> list(perms(['police', 'fish', 'cream']))
    [['police', 'fish', 'cream'], ['fish', 'police', 'cream'],
     ['fish', 'cream', 'police'], ['police', 'cream', 'fish'],
     ['cream', 'police', 'fish'], ['cream', 'fish', 'police']]

Deeply Nested Objects
---------------------

We can use recursive functions to build deeply-nested objects.

Building a letter trie, Listing trie_.

.. pylisting:: trie
   :caption: Building a Letter Trie

    def insert(trie, key, value):
        if key:
            first, rest = key[0], key[1:]
            if first not in trie:
                trie[first] = {}
            insert(trie[first], rest, value)
        else:
            trie['value'] = value

    >>> trie = {}
    >>> insert(trie, 'chat', 'cat')
    >>> insert(trie, 'chien', 'dog')
    >>> trie['c']['h']
    {'a': {'t': {'value': 'cat'}}, 'i': {'e': {'n': {'value': 'dog'}}}}
    >>> trie['c']['h']['a']['t']['value']
    'cat'
    >>> pprint(trie)
    {'c': {'h': {'a': {'t': {'value': 'cat'}},
                 'i': {'e': {'n': {'value': 'dog'}}}}}}


Recursion on Trees
------------------

1. recurse over tree to display in some useful way (e.g. whitespace formatting)

    >>> def indent_tree(t, level=0, first=False, width=8):
    ...     if not first:
    ...         print ' '*(width+1)*level,
    ...     try:
    ...         print "%-*s" % (width, t.node),
    ...         indent_tree(t[0], level+1, first=True)
    ...         for child in t[1:]:
    ...             indent_tree(child, level+1, first=False)
    ...     except AttributeError:
    ...         print t
    >>> t = extract(0, treebank.parsed())
    >>> indent_tree(t)

Dynamic Programming
-------------------

Dynamic programming is a general technique for designing algorithms
which is widely used in natural language processing.  The term
'programming' is used in a different sense to what you might expect,
to mean planning or scheduling.  Dynamic programming is used when a
problem contains overlapping sub-problems.  Instead of computing
solutions to these sub-problems repeatedly, we simply store them in a
lookup table.
In the remainder of this section we will introduce dynamic programming,
but in a rather different context to syntactic parsing.

Pingala was an Indian author who lived around the 5th century B.C.,
and wrote a treatise on Sanscrit prosody called the *Chandas Shastra*.
Virahanka extended this work around the 6th century A.D., studying the
number of ways of combining short and long syllables to create a meter
of length *n*.  He found, for example, that there are five ways to
construct a meter of length 4: *V*\ :subscript:`4` = *{LL, SSL, SLS,
LSS, SSSS}*.  Observe that we can split *V*\ :subscript:`4` into two
subsets, those starting with *L* and those starting with
*S*, as shown in v4_.


.. _v4:
.. ex::
   .. parsed-literal::
   
    *V*\ :subscript:`4` =
      LL, LSS
        i.e. L prefixed to each item of *V*\ :subscript:`2` = {L, SS}
      SSL, SLS, SSSS
        i.e. S prefixed to each item of *V*\ :subscript:`3` = {SL, LS, SSS}

.. pylisting:: virahanka
   :caption: Three Ways to Compute Sansrit Meter

    def virahanka1(n):
        if n == 0:
            return [""]
        elif n == 1:
            return ["S"]
        else:
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-1)]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in virahanka1(n-2)]
            return s + l
            
    def virahanka2(n):
        lookup = [[""], ["S"]]
        for i in range(n-1):
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in lookup[i+1]]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in lookup[i]]
            lookup.append(s + l)
        return lookup[n]

    def virahanka3(n, lookup={0:[""], 1:["S"]}):
        if n not in lookup:
            s = ["S" + prosody for prosody in virahanka3(n-1)]
            l = ["L" + prosody for prosody in virahanka3(n-2)]
            lookup[n] = s + l
        return lookup[n]
            
    >>> virahanka1(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  
    >>> virahanka2(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  
    >>> virahanka3(4)
    ['SSSS', 'SSL', 'SLS', 'LSS', 'LL']  

|nopar| 
With this observation, we can write a little recursive function called
``virahanka1()`` to compute these meters, shown in Listing virahanka_.
Notice that, in order to compute *V*\ :subscript:`4` we first compute
*V*\ :subscript:`3` and *V*\ :subscript:`2`.  But to compute *V*\ :subscript:`3`,
we need to first compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` and *V*\ :subscript:`1`.  This `call
structure`:dt: is depicted in the following tree:

.. ex:: 
   .. tree:: (V4 (V3 (V2 V1 V0) V1) (V2 V1 V0))

|nopar| 
As you can see, *V*\ :subscript:`2` is computed twice.
This might not seem like a significant problem, but 
it turns out to be rather wasteful as *n* gets large:
to compute *V*\ :subscript:`10` using this recursive technique, we
would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 34 times;
for *V*\ :subscript:`20` we would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 4,181 times;
for *V*\ :subscript:`30` we would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 514,229 times;
and
for *V*\ :subscript:`40` we would compute *V*\ :subscript:`2` 63,245,986 times!
A much better alternative is to store the value of *V*\ :subscript:`2` in a table
and look it up whenever we need it.  The same goes for other values, such
as *V*\ :subscript:`3` and so on.  Function ``virahanka2()`` implements a
dynamic programming approach to the problem.  It works by filling up a
table (called ``lookup``) with solutions to *all* smaller instances of the
problem, stopping as soon as we reach the value we're interested in.
At this point we read off the value and return it.  Crucially, each
sub-problem is only ever solved once.

Notice that the approach taken in ``virahanka2()`` is to solve smaller
problems on the way to solving larger problems.  Accordingly, this is known as the
`bottom-up`:dt: approach to dynamic programming.  Unfortunately it turns out
to be quite wasteful for some applications, since it
may compute solutions to sub-problems that are never required for
solving the main problem.  This wasted computation can be avoided
using the `top-down`:dt: approach to dynamic programming, which is
illustrated in the function ``virahanka3()`` in Listing virahanka_.
Unlike the bottom-up approach, this approach is recursive.  It avoids
the huge wastage of ``virahanka1()`` by checking whether it has
previously stored the result.  If not, it computes the result
recursively and stores it in the table.  The last step is to return
the stored result.

This concludes our brief introduction to dynamic programming.
We will encounter it again in Chapter chap-advanced-parsing_.

Exercises

#. |easy| Write a recursive function to traverse a tree and return the
   depth of the tree, such that a tree with a single node would have
   depth zero.  (Hint: the depth of a subtree is the maximum depth
   of its children, plus one.)

#. |soso| Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for
   a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal
   labels after their subtrees.  So the above example about Pierre
   Vinken would produce:
   ``[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S``
   Consecutive categories should be separated by space.
