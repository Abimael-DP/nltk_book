Appendix: NLTK Modules and Corpora
==================================

**NLTK Organization:**
NLTK is organized into a collection of task-specific packages.  Each
package is a combination of data structures for representing a
particular kind of information such as trees, and implementations of
standard algorithms involving those structures such as parsers.  This
approach is a standard feature of *object-oriented design*, in which
components encapsulate both the resources and methods needed to
accomplish a particular task.
    
The most fundamental NLTK components are for identifying and
manipulating individual words of text.  These include: ``tokenize``,
for breaking up strings of characters into word tokens; ``tag``, for
adding part-of-speech tags, including regular-expression taggers,
n-gram taggers and Brill taggers; and the Porter stemmer.
    
The second kind of module is for creating and manipulating structured
linguistic information.  These components include: ``tree``, for
representing and processing parse trees; ``featurestructure``, for
building and unifying nested feature structures (or attribute-value
matrices); ``cfg``, for specifying context-free grammars; and ``parse``, for
creating parse trees over input text, including chart parsers, chunk
parsers and probabilistic parsers.

Several utility components are provided to facilitate processing and
visualization.  These include: ``draw``, to visualize NLP structures
and processes; ``probability``, to count and collate events, and
perform statistical estimation; and ``corpora``, to access tagged
linguistic corpora.
    
.. Finally, several advanced components are provided, mostly
   demonstrating NLP applications of machine learning techniques.  These
   include: ``clusterer``, for discovering groups of similar items within
   a large collection, including k-means and expectation maximization;
   ``classifier``, for categorizing text into different types, including
   naive Bayes and maximum entropy; and ``hmm``, for Hidden Markov
   Models, useful for a variety of sequence classification tasks.
    
A further group of components is not part of NLTK proper.  These
are a wide selection of third-party contributions, often developed as
student projects at various institutions where NLTK is used, and
distributed in a separate package called *NLTK Contrib*.  Several of
these student contributions, such as the Brill tagger and the HMM
module, have now been incorporated into NLTK.  Although these
contributed components are not maintained, they may serve as a useful starting
point for future student projects.
    
In addition to software and documentation, NLTK provides substantial
corpus samples.  Many of these can be accessed using the ``corpora``
module, avoiding the need to write specialized file parsing code
before you can do NLP tasks.  These corpora include: Brown Corpus
|mdash| 1.15 million words of tagged text in 15 genres; a 10% sample
of the Penn Treebank corpus, consisting of 40,000 words of
syntactically parsed text; a selection of books from Project Gutenberg
totally 1.7 million words; and other corpora for chunking,
prepositional phrase attachment, word-sense disambiguation,
information extraction.
