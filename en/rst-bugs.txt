Subexamples
-----------

.. _thisdog:
.. ex::
   .. _thisdoga:
   .. ex::
      this dog
   .. _thisdogb:
   .. ex::
      \*these dog

|nopar| It would be better if this could be rendered along the following
lines::

  (1) a.  this dog
      b. *these dog


|nopar| However, the following cross-references are fine as they stand:
examples thisdog_ contains thisdoga_ and thisdogb_.


Gloss Directive
---------------

In the PDF output, the
example number should be lined up with the top of the table, rather
than the centre. (Also, seems to be incorrectly coming out as '(2a)'
rather than just '(2)'.)

.. ex::
   .. gloss::
      un                         | cuadro  | hermos-o
      INDEF.SG.MASC              | picture | beautiful-SG.MASC
      'a beautiful picture'         


|nopar| In the HTML output, there is too much interline space when the
gloss is embedded inside an exercise:

#. |soso| Augment agcfg1_ so that it will correctly describe the following
   Spanish noun phrases:

    .. ex::
       .. gloss::
	  un                         | cuadro  | hermos-o
	  INDEF.SG.MASC              | picture | beautiful-SG.MASC
	  'a beautiful picture'               


AVMs
----

The following AVM doesn't get parsed properly. (Not too serious --- we
could drop this example if fixing it is tricky.)

.. _reentrant03:
.. ex::
      .. avm:: 

	 [ A = (1) [ ] ]
	 [ B = (2) [ ] ]
	 [ C -> (1)    ]
	 [ D -> (2)    ]


Pylisting
---------

#. Clicking on a tag hyperlink in running text takes you to the first page of the PDF file
#. Tag result_ now appears in doctest block, but test/doctest_driver.py will need to be tweaked

.. pylisting:: foo
   :caption: Pylisting

    >>> a = 1       # [_assignment]
    >>> a
    1               # [_result]
