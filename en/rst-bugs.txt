Chapter Numbering
-----------------

This document isn't a chapter -- how can we stop it
from getting "Chapter 1" at the top?  (Needed for prefaces.)


Pylisting
---------

#. Clicking on a tag hyperlink in running text takes you to the first page of the PDF file
#. Tag result_ does not appear in doctest block

.. pylisting:: foo
   :caption: Pylisting

    >>> a = 1       # [_assignment]
    >>> a
    1               # [_result]

Figures
-------

#. Sometimes the word `Figure`:em: is swallowed up and the prose
   contains only the bare figure number.

Error Line Numbers
------------------

Here's an
  unexpected
unindent, on line 63 of the file.

It gives the error ``rst-bugs.txt:269: (WARNING/2) Definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.``

Code inside a note
------------------

Code that appears inside a note is wrapped.

.. Note:: Integers, strings and lists are all kinds of `data
   types`:dt: in Python. In fact, every value in Python has a
   type. The type determines what operations you can perform on the
   data value. So, for example, we have seen that we can index strings
   and lists, but we can't index integers:
         
      >>> one = 'cat'
      >>> one[0]
      'c'
      >>> two = [1, 2, 3]
      >>> two[1]
      2
      >>> three = 3
      >>> three[2]
      Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "<pyshell#95>", line 1, in -toplevel-
	  three[2]
      TypeError: 'int' object is unsubscriptable
      >>>
