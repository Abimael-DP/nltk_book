**Introduction to Part II**

Part II covers the linguistic and computational analysis of sentences.
We will see that sentences have systematic structure;
we use this to communicate who did what to whom.
Linguistic structures are formalized using context-free grammars,
and processed computationally using parsers.
Various extensions are covered, including chart parsers and probabilistic parsers.
Part II also introduces the techniques in structured programming
needed for implementing grammars and parsers.
