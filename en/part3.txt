**Introduction to Part III**

Part III covers a selection of advanced topics.
It begins with a chapter on applied programming in Python,
covering topics in program development, standard libraries,
and algorithm design.  The following two chapters focus on
making grammars more expressive, first by adding the powerful
notation of distinctive features, and then by using this to
add semantic interpretation.  The final chapter deals with
linguistic data management.
