Introduction
------------

|nopar|
Language can be divided up into pieces of varying sizes, ranging from
morphemes to paragraphs.  In this chapter we will focus on words, the
most fundamental level for |NLP|.  Just what are words, and
how should we represent them in a machine?  These questions may seem
trivial, but we'll see that there are some important
issues involved in defining and representing words.
Once we've tackled them, we're in a good position to do further
processing, such as find related words and analyze the
style of a text (this chapter), to categorize words (Chapter chap-tag_),
to group them into phrases (Chapter chap-chunk_ and Part II),
and to do a variety of language engineering tasks (Chapter chap-engineering_).

In the following sections, we will explore the division of text into
words; the distinction between types and tokens; sources of text data
including files, the web, and linguistic corpora; accessing these
sources using Python and NLTK; stemming and normalisation;
the WordNet lexical database; and a variety of useful programming tasks involving words.

.. note:: From this chapter onwards, our program samples will assume you
   begin your interactive session or your program with: ``from nltk.book import *``

-----------------------
Tokens, Types and Texts
-----------------------

In Chapter chap-introduction_, we showed how a string could be split into a
list of words.  Once we have derived a list, the ``len()`` function
will count the number of words it contains:

    >>> sentence = "This is the time -- and this is the record of the time."
    >>> words = sentence.split()
    >>> len(words)
    13

|nopar| This process of segmenting a string of characters into words
is known as `tokenization`:dt:. Tokenization is a prelude to pretty
much everything else we might want to do in |NLP|, since it tells our
processing software what our basic units are. We will discuss
tokenization in more detail shortly.


We also pointed out that we could compile a list of the unique
vocabulary items in a string by using ``set()`` to eliminate
duplicates:

    >>> len(set(words))
    10

|nopar| So if we ask how many words there are in ``sentence``, we get
different answers depending on whether we count duplicates. 
Clearly we are using different senses of "word" here. To help
distinguish between them, let's introduce two terms:
`token`:dt: and `type`:dt:.  A word token is an individual occurrence
of a word in a concrete context; it exists in time and space.  A word
`type`:dt: is a more abstract; it's what we're talking about when we
say that the three occurrences of ``the`` in ``sentence`` are  "the same word."

Something similar to a type-token distinction is reflected in the following
snippet of Python:

    >>> words[2]
    'the'
    >>> words[2] == words[8]
    True
    >>> words[2] is words[8]
    False
    >>> words[2] is words[2]
    True

|nopar| The operator ``==`` tests whether two expressions are equal, and in
this case, it is testing for string-identity. This is the notion of
identity that was assumed by our use of ``set()`` above. By contrast, the
``is`` operator tests whether two objects are stored in the same
location of memory, and is therefore analogous to token-identity.  
When we used ``split()`` to turn a string into a list of words,
our tokenization method was to say that any strings which
are delimited by whitespace count as a word token. But this simple
approach doesn't always give the desired results.
Also, testing string-identity isn't a very useful criterion for
assigning tokens to types. We therefore need to address two questions
in more detail:
*Tokenization:* Which substrings of the original text should be treated as word tokens?
*Type definition:* How do we decide whether two tokens have the same type?

To see the problems with our first stab at defining tokens and types
in ``sentence``, let's look at the actual tokens we found:

    >>> set(words)
    set(['and', 'this', 'record', 'This', 'of', 'is', '--', 'time.',
    'time', 'the']

|nopar|
Observe that ``'time'`` and ``'time.'`` are incorrectly
treated as distinct types since the trailing period
has been bundled with the rest of the word.
Although ``'--'`` is some kind of token, it's not a `word`:em: token.
Additionally, ``'This'`` and ``'this'`` are incorrectly distinguished
from each other, because of a difference in capitalization that should
be ignored.

If we turn to languages other than English, tokenizing text is even more
challenging.  In Chinese text there is no visual representation of word
boundaries.  Consider the following
three-character string: |ai4|\ |guo3|\ |ren2| (in pinyin plus tones:
ai4 "love" (verb), guo3 "country", ren2 "person"). This could
either be segmented as [|ai4|\ |guo3|]\ |ren2|\ ,
"country-loving person" or as |ai4|\ [|guo3|\ |ren2|]\ ,
"love country-person."

The terms *token* and *type* can also be applied to other linguistic
entities.  For example, a `sentence token`:dt: is an individual
occurrence of a sentence; but a `sentence type`:dt: is an abstract
sentence, without context. If I say the same sentence twice, I have
uttered two sentence tokens but only used one sentence type.  When the kind
of token or type is obvious from context, we will simply use the terms
token and type.

To summarize, we cannot just say that two word tokens have the same type if they are
the same string of characters.  We need to
consider a variety of factors in determining what counts as
the same word, and we need to be careful in how we
identify tokens in the first place. 

Up till now, we have relied on getting our source texts by defining a string in
a fragment of Python code. However, this is impractical
for all but the simplest of texts, and makes it hard to present
realistic examples. So how do we get larger chunks of
text into our programs?  In the rest of this section, we will see how
to extract text from files, from the web, and from the corpora
distributed with |NLTK|.

.. _reading-files:

Extracting text from files
--------------------------

.. Monkey-patching to fake the file/web examples in this section:

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> def fake_open(filename, mode=None):
    ...     return StringIO('Hello World!\nThis is a test file.\n')
    >>> def fake_urlopen(url):
    ...     return StringIO('<!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"')
    >>> open = fake_open
    >>> import urllib
    >>> urllib.urlopen = fake_urlopen

It is easy to access local files in Python.  As an exercise, create a
file called ``corpus.txt`` using a text editor, and enter the
following text::

   Hello World!
   This is a test file.


|nopar| 
Be sure to save the file as plain text. You also need to make sure
that you have saved the file in the same directory or folder in which
you are running the Python interactive interpreter.

.. Note:: If you are using |IDLE|, you can easily create this file by
   selecting the *New Window* command in the *File* menu, typing
   the required text into this window, and then saving the file as
   ``corpus.txt`` in the first directory that |IDLE| offers in the
   pop-up dialogue box.


|nopar| 
The next step is to `open`:dt: a file using the built-in function ``open()``
which takes two arguments, the name of the file, here ``corpus.txt``, and the
mode to open the file with (``'r'`` means to open the file for reading,
and ``'U'`` stands for "Universal", which lets us ignore the different
conventions used for marking newlines).

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> f = open('corpus.txt', 'rU')

.. Note:: If the interpreter cannot find your file, it will give an
   error like this:

   .. doctest-ignore::
      >>> f = open('corpus.txt', 'rU')
      Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<pyshell#7>", line 1, in -toplevel-
	  f = open('corpus.txt', 'rU')
      IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'corpus.txt'

   To check that the file that you are trying to open is really in the
   right directory, use |IDLE|\ 's *Open* command in the *File* menu;
   this will display a list of all the files in the directory where
   |IDLE| is running. An alternative is to examine the current
   directory from within Python:

.. doctest-ignore::
      >>> import os
      >>> os.listdir('.')

|nopar| 
There are several methods for reading the file.
The following uses the method ``read()`` on the file object
``f``; this reads the entire contents of a file into a string.

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> f.read() 
    'Hello World!\nThis is a test file.\n'

|nopar|
Recall that the ``'\n'`` characters are `newlines`:dt:\ ; this
is equivalent to pressing *Enter* on a keyboard and starting a new line. 
Note that we can open and read a file in one step:

    >>> text = open('corpus.txt', 'rU').read()

|nopar|
We can also read a file one line at a time using the ``for`` loop construct:

    >>> f = open('corpus.txt', 'rU')
    >>> for line in f:
    ...     print line[:-1]
    Hello world!
    This is a test file.

|nopar| 
Here we use the slice ``[:-1]`` to remove the newline character at the end of
the input line.  

Extracting text from the Web
----------------------------

Opening a web page is not much different to opening a file, except that
we use ``urlopen()``:

    >>> from urllib import urlopen
    >>> page = urlopen("http://news.bbc.co.uk/").read()
    >>> print page[:60]
    <!doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"

|nopar| 
Web pages are usually in |HTML| format.  To extract the text, we
need to strip out the |HTML| markup, i.e. remove all material enclosed in
angle brackets. Let's digress briefly to consider how to carry out
this task using regular expressions. Our first attempt might look as
follows:

    >>> line = '<title>BBC NEWS | News Front Page</title>'
    >>> new = re.sub(r'<.*>', '', line)

|nopar| 
So the regular expression ``'<.*>'`` is intended to match a
pair of left and right angle brackets, with a string of any characters
intervening. However, look at what the result is:

    >>> new
    '' 

|nopar| 
What has happened here? The problem is twofold. First,
the wildcard ``'.'`` matches any character other than ``'\n'``,
so it will match ``'>'`` and ``'<'``.
Second, the ``'*'`` operator is "greedy", in the sense that it matches
as many characters as it can. In the above example,
``'.*'`` will return not the shortest match, namely
``'title'``, but the longest match, ``'title>BBC NEWS | News Front
Page</title'``.   To get the *shortest* match we have to use the ``'*?'`` operator.
We will also normalise whitespace, replacing any sequence
of one or more spaces, tabs or newlines (these are all matched by
``'\s+'``) with a single space character:

    >>> page = re.sub('<.*?>', '', page)
    >>> page = re.sub('\s+', ' ', page)
    >>> print page[:60]
     BBC NEWS | News Front Page News Sport Weather World Service

You will probably find it useful to borrow the structure of this code
snippet for future tasks involving regular expressions: each time
through a series of substitutions, the result of operating on ``page``
gets assigned as the new value of ``page``. This approach allows us to
decompose the transformations we need into a series of simple regular
expression substitutions, each of which can be tested and debugged on
its own.

.. _sec-extracting-text:

Extracting text from NLTK Corpora
---------------------------------

|NLTK| is distributed with several corpora and corpus samples and many
are supported by the ``corpus`` package.  Here we use
a selection of texts from the `Project Gutenberg
<http://www.gutenberg.org/>`_ electronic text archive, and list the
items it contains:

    >>> corpus.gutenberg.items
    ['austen-emma', 'austen-persuasion', 'austen-sense', 'bible-kjv',
    'blake-poems', 'blake-songs', 'chesterton-ball', 'chesterton-brown',
    'chesterton-thursday', 'milton-paradise', 'shakespeare-caesar',
    'shakespeare-hamlet', 'shakespeare-macbeth', 'whitman-leaves']

|nopar|
Next we iterate over the text content to find the number of word tokens:

    >>> count = 0
    >>> for word in corpus.gutenberg.read('whitman-leaves'):
    ...     count += 1
    >>> print count
    154873

The Brown Corpus was the first million-word,
part-of-speech tagged electronic corpus of English, created in 1961 at
Brown University.  Each of the sections ``a`` through ``r`` represents
a different genre.

    >>> corpus.brown.items
    ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'p', 'r']
    >>> corpus.brown.documents['a']
    'press: reportage'

|nopar|
We can extract individual sentences (as lists of words) from the
corpus using the ``read()`` function.  Here we will specify
section ``a``, and indicate that only words (and not part-of-speech tags)
should be produced.

    >>> a = corpus.brown.tokenized('a')
    >>> a[0]
    ['The', 'Fulton', 'County', 'Grand', 'Jury', 'said', 'Friday', 'an',
    'investigation', 'of', "Atlanta's", 'recent', 'primary', 'election',
    'produced', '``', 'no', 'evidence', "''", 'that', 'any', 'irregularities',
    'took', 'place', '.']

Before concluding this section, we return to the original topic of
distinguishing tokens and types.  Now that we can access substantial
quantities of text, we will give a preview of the interesting computations
we will be learning how to do (without yet explaining all the details).
Listing vocabulary-growth_ computes vocabulary growth curves
for US Presidents, shown in Figure fig-vocabulary-growth_
(a color figure in the online version).
These curves show the number of word types seen after `n`:math: word tokens
have been read.

.. Note:: Listing vocabulary-growth_ uses the PyLab package which supports sophisticated
   plotting functions with a MATLAB-style interface.  For more information about
   this package please see ``http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/``.

------------------------------
Tokenization and Normalization
------------------------------

Tokenization, as we saw, is the task of extracting a sequence of elementary tokens
that constitute a piece of language data. In our first attempt to
carry out this task, we started off with a string of characters, and
used the ``split()`` method to break the string at whitespace
characters. Recall that "whitespace" covers not only interword space,
but also tabs and newlines.
We pointed out that tokenization
based solely on whitespace is too simplistic for most applications.
In this section we will take a more sophisticated approach, using
regular expressions to specify which character sequences should be
treated as words.  We will also look at ways to normalize tokens.

Tokenization with Regular Expressions
-------------------------------------

The function ``tokenize.regexp()`` takes a text string and a
regular expression, and returns the list of substrings that match the
regular expression.  To define a tokenizer that includes punctuation
as separate tokens, we could do the following:

    >>> text = '''Hello.  Isn't this fun?'''
    >>> pattern = r'\w+|[^\w\s]+'
    >>> list(tokenize.regexp(text, pattern))
    ['Hello', '.', 'Isn', "'", 't', 'this', 'fun', '?']

|nopar| 
The regular expression in this example will match a sequence
consisting of one or more word characters ``\w+``.  It will also match
a sequence consisting of one or more punctuation characters (or
non-word, non-space characters ``[^\w\s]+``).  This is another negated range
expression; it matches one or more characters which are not word
characters (i.e., not a match for ``\w``) and not a whitespace
character (i.e., not a match for ``\s``).  We use the disjunction
operator ``|`` to combine these into a single complex expression
``\w+|[^\w\s]+``.

There are a number of ways we could improve on this regular
expression.  For example, it currently breaks `$22.50`:lx: into four
tokens; we might want it to treat this as a single token.
Similarly, `U.S.A.` should count as a single token.  We can
deal with these by adding further cases to the regular
expression.  For readability we will break it up and insert comments, and
use the ``re.VERBOSE`` flag so that Python knows to strip out the
embedded whitespace and comments.

    >>> text = 'That poster costs $22.40.'
    >>> pattern = re.compile(r'''
    ...     \w+               # sequences of 'word' characters
    ...   | \$?\d+(\.\d+)?    # currency amounts, e.g. $12.50
    ...   | [\A\.]+           # abbreviations, e.g. U.S.A.
    ...   | [^\w\s]+          # sequences of punctuation
    ... ''', re.VERBOSE)
    >>> list(tokenize.regexp(text, pattern))
    ['That', 'poster', 'costs', '$22.40', '.']

It is sometimes more convenient to write a regular expression
matching the material that appears *between* tokens, such as whitespace
and punctuation.  The ``tokenize.regexp()`` function permits
an optional boolean parameter ``gaps``; when set to ``True`` the
pattern is matched against the gaps.  For example, here is how
``tokenize.whitespace()`` is defined:

    >>> list(tokenize.regexp(text, pattern=r'\s+', gaps=True))
    ['That', 'poster', 'costs', '$22.40.']

Of course it is more convenient to call it directly:

    >>> list(tokenize.whitespace(text))
    ['That', 'poster', 'costs', '$22.40.']
    
.. Note:: It is possible to do simple kinds of tokenization using ``re.findall()``,
   but the |NLTK| tokenizers are more efficient for processing large corpora because
   they are implemented as `iterators`:dt:, only producing tokens as they are used
   by a calling program.

Lemmatization and Normalization
-------------------------------

Earlier we talked about counting word tokens, and completely ignored
the rest of the sentence in which these tokens appeared.  Thus, for an
example like `I saw the saw`:lx:, we would have treated both `saw`:lx:
tokens as instances of the same type.  However, one is a form of the
verb `see`:lx:, and the other is the name of a cutting instrument.
How do we know that these two forms of `saw`:lx: are unrelated?  One
answer is that as speakers of English, we know that these would appear
as different entries in a dictionary. Another, more empiricist, answer
is that if we looked at a large enough number of texts, it would
become clear that the two forms have very different distributions. For
example, only the noun `saw`:lx: will occur immediately after
determiners such as `the`:lx:.  Distinct words which have the same
written form are called `homographs`:dt:. We can distinguish
homographs with the help of context; often the previous word suffices.
We will explore this idea of context briefly, before addressing the
main topic of this section.

As a first approximation to discovering the distribution of a word, we
can look at all the bigrams it occurs in.
A `bigram`:dt: is simply a pair of words.
For example, in the sentence `She sells sea shells by the sea shore`:lx:,
the bigrams are
`She sells`:lx:,
`sells sea`:lx:,
`sea shells`:lx:,
`shells by`:lx:,
`by the`:lx:,
`the sea`:lx:,
`sea shore`:lx:.
Let's consider all bigrams from the Brown Corpus which have the
word `often`:lx: as first element.
Here is a small selection, ordered by their counts::

    often ,		16
    often a		10
    often in		8
    often than		7
    often the		7
    often been		6
    often do		5
    often called  	4
    often appear	3
    often were		3
    often appeared	2
    often are		2
    often did		2
    often is		2
    often appears	1
    often call   	1

|nopar|
In the topmost entry, we see that `often`:lx: is frequently followed
by a comma.  This suggests that `often`:lx: is common at the end of
phrases. We also see that `often`:lx: precedes verbs, presumably as an
adverbial modifier.  We might conclude that when `saw`:lx:
appears in the context `often saw`:lx:, then `saw`:lx: is being used
as a verb.

You will also see that this list includes different grammatical forms
of the same verb. We can form separate groups consisting of
`appear`:lx: |tilde| `appears`:lx: |tilde| `appeared`:lx:; `call`:lx:
|tilde| `called`:lx:; `do`:lx: |tilde| `did`:lx:; and `been`:lx:
|tilde| `were`:lx: |tilde| `are`:lx: |tilde| `is`:lx:.  It is common
in linguistics to say that two forms such as `appear`:lx: and
`appeared`:lx: belong to a more abstract notion of a word called a
`lexeme`:dt:; by contast, `appeared`:lx: and `called`:lx: belong to
different lexemes. You can think of a lexeme as corresponding to an
entry in a dictionary, and a `lemma`:dt: as the headword for that entry.
By convention, small capitals are used when referring to a lexeme or lemma: `appear`:lex:.

Although `appeared`:lx: and `called`:lx: belong to different lexemes,
they do have something in common: they are both past tense forms. This
is signalled by the segment `-ed`:lx:, which we call a morphological
`suffix`:dt:. We also say that such morphologically complex forms are
`inflected`:dt:.  If we strip off the suffix, we get something called
the `stem`:dt:, namely `appear`:lx: and `call`:lx: respectively. While
`appeared`:lx:, `appears`:lx: and `appearing`:lx: are all
morphologically inflected, `appear`:lx: lacks any morphological
inflection and is therefore termed the `base`:dt: form. In English,
the base form is conventionally used as the `lemma`:dt: for a word.

Our notion of context would be more compact if we could group
different forms of the various verbs into their lemmas; then we could
study which verb lexemes are typically modified by a particular
adverb. `Lemmatization`:dt: |mdash| the process of mapping words
to their lemmas |mdash| would yield the
following picture of the distribution of `often`:lx:.
Here, the counts for `often appear`:lx: (3),
`often appeared`:lx: (2) and `often appears`:lx: (1)
are combined into a single line.

  ::

    often ,		16
    often a		10
    often be		13
    often in		8
    often than		7
    often the		7
    often do		7
    often appear	6
    often call		5

Lemmatization is a rather sophisticated process which uses rules
for the regular word patterns, and table look-up for
the irregular patterns. Within |NLTK|, we can use off-the-shelf
stemmers, such as the `Porter Stemmer`:dt: and the `Lancaster Stemmer`:dt:, e.g.:

    >>> stemmer = stem.Porter()
    >>> verbs = ['appears', 'appear', 'appeared', 'calling', 'called']
    >>> stems = [stemmer.stem(verb) for verb in verbs]
    >>> sorted(set(stems))
    ['appear', 'call']
    
Lemmatization and stemming are special cases of `normalization`:dt:.
They identify a canonical representative for a set of related word forms.
Normalization collapses distinctions.  Exactly how we normalize words depends
on the application.  Often, we convert everything into lower
case so that we can ignore the written distinction between sentence-initial
words and the rest of the words in the sentence.
The Python string method ``lower()`` will accomplish this for us:

    >>> str = 'This is the time'
    >>> str.lower()
    'this is the time'

.. We need to be careful, however; case normalization will also collapse the `New`:lx:
   of `New York`:lx: with the `new`:lx: of `my new car`:lx:.
   [SB: this mixes the issue with named entity detection, and should probably
   be left to the engineering chapter]

A final issue for normalization is the presence of contractions, such
as `didn't`:lx:.  If we are analyzing the meaning
of a sentence, it would probably be more useful to normalize this
form to two separate forms: `did`:lx: and `n't`:lx: (or `not`:lx").

.. _sec-list-comprehensions:

Aside: List Comprehensions
--------------------------

Lemmatization and normalization involve applying the same operation to
each word token in a text.  `List comprehensions`:dt: are a convenient Python
construct for doing this.  Here we lowercase each word:

    >>> sent = ['The', 'dog', 'gave', 'John', 'the', 'newspaper']
    >>> [word.lower() for word in sent]
    ['the', 'dog', 'gave', 'john', 'the', 'newspaper']

|nopar|
Here we rewrite the loop for identifying verb stems that we saw in
the previous section:

    >>> [stemmer.stem(verb) for verb in verbs]
    ['appear', 'appear', 'appear', 'call', 'call']
    >>> set(stemmer.stem(verb) for verb in verbs)
    set(['call', 'appear'])

|nopar|
And here we rewrite the word counting code from Section sec-extracting-text_:

    >>> print len([word for word in corpus.gutenberg.read('whitman-leaves')])
    154873

.. note:: Note that whenever you see a list comprehension of the form
   ``[x for x in y]`` you can simply convert ``y`` to a list using ``list(y)`` instead.

|nopar|
This syntax might be reminiscent of the notation used for building
sets, e.g. {(x,y) | x\ :superscript:`2` + y\ :superscript:`2` = 1}.
(We will return to sets later in Section sec-sets_).
Just as this set definition incorporates a constraint, list
comprehensions can constrain the items they include.  In the next
example we remove some non-content words from a list of words:

    >>> def is_lexical(word):
    ...     return word.lower() not in ('a', 'an', 'the', 'that', 'to')
    >>> [word for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]
    ['dog', 'gave', 'John', 'newspaper']

|nopar|
Now we can combine the two ideas (constraints and normalization),
to pull out the content words and normalize them.

    >>> [word.lower() for word in sent if is_lexical(word)]
    ['dog', 'gave', 'john', 'newspaper']

List comprehensions can build nested structures too.  For example,
the following code builds a list of tuples, where each tuple consists
of a word and its stem.

    >>> sent = corpus.brown.tokenized('a')[0]
    >>> [(x, stemmer.stem(x).lower()) for x in sent]
    [('The', 'the'), ('Fulton', 'fulton'), ('County', 'counti'),
    ('Grand', 'grand'), ('Jury', 'juri'), ('said', 'said'), ('Friday', 'friday'),
    ('an', 'an'), ('investigation', 'investig'), ('of', 'of'),
    ("Atlanta's", "atlanta'"), ('recent', 'recent'), ('primary', 'primari'),
    ('election', 'elect'), ('produced', 'produc'), ('``', '``'), ('no', 'no'),
    ('evidence', 'evid'), ("''", "''"), ('that', 'that'), ('any', 'ani'),
    ('irregularities', 'irregular'), ('took', 'took'), ('place', 'place'), ('.', '.')]

   Save some text into a file ``corpus.txt``.  Define a function ``load(f)``
   that reads from the file named in its sole argument, and returns a string
   containing the text of the file.

   a) Use ``tokenize.regexp()`` to create a tokenizer which tokenizes
      the various kinds of punctuation in this text.  Use a single
      regular expression, with inline comments using the
      ``re.VERBOSE`` flag.

      the following kinds of expression: monetary amounts; dates; names
      of people and companies.

   words?  Or should we say that it's a single compound word?  Or should
   we say that it is actually *nine* words, since it's read "four point
   five three, plus or minus fifteen percent"?  Or should we say that

Counting Words: Several Interesting Applications
------------------------------------------------

Now that we can count words (tokens or types), we can write
programs to perform a variety of useful tasks, to study
stylistic differences in language use, differences between
languages, and even to generate random text.

Before getting started, we need to see how to get Python to
count the number of occurrences of *each* word in a document.

    >>> counts = nltk.defaultdict(int)           # [_count-initialization]
    >>> sec_a = corpus.brown.tokenized('a', group_by_sent=False)
    >>> for token in sec_a:
    ...     counts[token] += 1                   # [_count-increment]
    >>> for token in sorted(counts)[:5]:         # [_count-output]
    ...     print counts[token], token
    38 !
    5 $1
    2 $1,000
    1 $1,000,000,000
    3 $1,500
    
In line count-initialization_ we initialize the dictionary.
Then for each word in each sentence we increment a counter (line count-increment_).
To view the contents of the dictionary, we can iterate over its keys and print
each entry (here just for the first 5 entries, line count-output_).

Frequency Distributions
-----------------------

This style of output and our ``counts`` object
are just different forms of the same abstract structure
|mdash| a collection of items and their frequencies |mdash|
known as a `frequency distribution`:dt:.
Since we will often need to count things, NLTK provides
a ``FreqDist()`` class.  We can write the same code more
conveniently as follows:

    >>> fd = nltk.FreqDist(sec_a)
    >>> for token in sorted(fd)[:5]:
    ...     print fd[token], token
    38 !
    5 $1
    2 $1,000
    1 $1,000,000,000
    3 $1,500

Some of the methods defined on NLTK frequency distributions are shown in Table freqdist_.

.. table:: freqdist

   ==========  ===================  =======================================================
   Name        Sample               Description
   ==========  ===================  =======================================================
   Count       ``fd['the']``        number of times a given sample occurred
   Frequency   ``fd.freq('the')``   frequency of a given sample
   N           ``fd.N()``           number of samples
   Samples     ``list(fd)``         list of distinct samples recorded (also ``fd.keys()``)
   Max         ``fd.max()``         sample with the greatest number of outcomes
   ==========  ===================  =======================================================

   Frequency Distribution Module


|nopar|
This output isn't very interesting.
Perhaps it would be more informative to list the most frequent word tokens first.
Now a ``FreqDist`` object is just a kind of dictionary, so we can easily get
its key-value pairs and sort them by decreasing values, as follows:

    >>> from operator import itemgetter
    >>> sorted_word_counts = sorted(fd.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)  # [_sorted-args]
    >>> [token for (token, freq) in sorted_word_counts[:20]]
    ['the', ',', '.', 'of', 'and', 'to', 'a', 'in', 'for', 'The', 'that',
    '``', 'is', 'was', "''", 'on', 'at', 'with', 'be', 'by']

Note the arguments of the ``sorted()`` function (line sorted-args_): ``itemgetter(1)``
returns a function that can be called on any sequence object to return the item at position ``1``;
``reverse=True`` performs the sort in reverse order.  Together, these ensure that the
word with the highest frequency is listed first.  This reversed sort by frequency is
such a common requirement that it is built into the ``FreqDist`` object.
Listing print-freq_ demonstrates this, and also prints rank and cumulative frequency.

.. pylisting:: print-freq
   :caption: Words and Cumulative Frequencies, in Order of Decreasing Frequency
    
    def print_freq(tokens, num=50):
        fd = nltk.FreqDist(tokens)
        cumulative = 0.0
        rank = 0
        for word in fd.sorted()[:num]:
            rank += 1
            cumulative += fd[word] * 100.0 / fd.N()
            print "%3d %3.2d%% %s" % (rank, cumulative, word)

    >>> print_freq(corpus.brown.tokenized('a', group_by_sent=False), 20)
      1  05% the
      2  10% ,
      3  14% .
      4  17% of
      5  19% and
      6  21% to
      7  23% a
      8  25% in
      9  26% for
     10  27% The
     11  28% that
     12  28% ``
     13  29% is
     14  30% was
     15  31% ''
     16  31% on
     17  32% at
     18  32% with
     19  33% be
     20  33% by
     
Unfortunately the output in Listing print-freq_ is surprisingly dull.
A mere handful of tokens account for a third of the text.  They just represent
the plumbing of English text, and are completely uninformative!
How can we find words that are more indicative of a text?
As we will see in the exercises for this section, we can modify
the program to discard the non-content words.  In the next
section we see another approach.

Stylistics
----------

Stylistics is a broad term covering literary genres and varieties of language use.
Here we will look at a document collection that is categorized by genre,
and try to learn something about the patterns of word usage.
For example, Table brown-modals_ was constructed by counting
the number of times various modal words appear
in different sections of the corpus:

.. table:: brown-modals

   ==================  ===  =====  ===  =====  ====  ====
   Genre               can  could  may  might  must  will 
   ==================  ===  =====  ===  =====  ====  ====
   skill and hobbies   273  59     130  22     83    259 
   humor               17   33     8    8      9     13 
   fiction: science    16   49     4    12     8     16 
   press: reportage    94   86     66   36     50    387 
   fiction: romance    79   195    11   51     46    43 
   religion            84   59     79   12     54    64 
   ==================  ===  =====  ===  =====  ====  ====

   Use of Modals in Brown Corpus, by Genre

|nopar|
Observe that the most frequent modal in the reportage genre is
`will`:lx:, suggesting a focus on the future, while the most frequent
modal in the romance genre is `could`:lx:, suggesting a focus on
possibilities.

We can also measure the lexical diversity of a genre, by
calculating the ratio of word types and word tokens, as
shown in Table brown-types_.  Genres with lower diversity
have a higher number of tokens per type, thus we see that
humorous prose is almost twice as lexically diverse as
romance prose.

.. table:: brown-types

   ==================  ===========  ==========  =====
   Genre               Token Count  Type Count  Ratio
   ==================  ===========  ==========  =====
   skill and hobbies   82345        11935       6.9
   humor               21695        5017        4.3
   fiction: science    14470        3233        4.5
   press: reportage    100554       14394       7.0
   fiction: romance    70022        8452        8.3
   religion            39399        6373        6.2
   ==================  ===========  ==========  =====

   Lexical Diversity of Various Genres in the Brown Corpus

We can carry out a variety of interesting explorations simply by
counting words.  In fact, the field of `Corpus Linguistics`:dt: focuses
heavily on creating and interpreting such tables of word counts.

Lexical Dispersion
------------------

Word tokens vary in their distribution throughout a text.  We can
visualize word distributions to get an overall sense of topics and topic
shifts.  For example, consider the pattern of mention of the main
characters in Jane Austen's *Sense and Sensibility*: Elinor, Marianne,
Edward and Willoughby.  The following plot contains four rows, one for
each name, in the order just given.  Each row contains a series of lines, drawn
to indicate the position of each token.

.. figure:: ../images/words-dispersion.png

   Lexical Dispersion Plot for the Main Characters in *Sense and Sensibility*

As you can see, `Elinor`:lx: and `Marianne`:lx: appear rather uniformly throughout
the text, while `Edward`:lx: and `Willoughby`:lx: tend to appear separately.
Here is the program that generated the above plot.  [NB. Requires |NLTK|-Lite 0.6.7].

.. doctest-ignore::
    >>> words = ['Elinor', 'Marianne', 'Edward', 'Willoughby']
    >>> nltk.draw.dispersion.plot(corpus.gutenberg.read('austen-sense'), words)

Comparing Word Lengths in Different Languages
---------------------------------------------

We can use a frequency distribution to examine the distribution
of word lengths in a corpus.  For each word, we find its length,
and increment the count for words of this length.

    >>> def print_length_dist(text):
    ...     fd = nltk.FreqDist(len(token) for token in text if re.match(r'\w+$', token))
    ...     for i in range(1,15):
    ...         print "%2d" % int(100*fd.freq(i)),
    ...     print

|nopar|
Now we can call ``print_length_dist`` on a text to print the distribution of
word lengths.  We see that the most frequent word length for the English
sample is 3 characters, while the most frequent length for the Finnish
sample is 5-6 characters.

    >>> print_length_dist(corpus.genesis.tokenized('english-kjv'))
     2 15 30 23 12  6  4  2  1  0  0  0  0  0
    >>> print_length_dist(corpus.genesis.tokenized('finnish'))
     0 12  6 10 17 17 11  9  5  3  2  1  0  0
    
This is an intriguing area for exploration, and so in Listing word-len-dist_
we look at it on a larger scale using the Universal Declaration of Human Rights corpus,
which has text samples from over 300 languages.
(Note that the names of the items in this corpus include
information about character encoding; here we will use texts in ISO Latin-1.)
The output is shown in Figure fig-word-len-dist_ (a color figure in the online version).
  
.. pylisting:: word-len-dist
   :caption: Cumulative Word Length Distributions for Several Languages

    import pylab
    
    def cld(lang):
        text = corpus.udhr.read(lang)
        fd = nltk.FreqDist(len(token) for token in text)
        ld = [100*fd.freq(i) for i in range(36)]
        return [sum(ld[0:i+1]) for i in range(len(ld))]

    >>> langs = ['Chickasaw-Latin1', 'English-Latin1',

   Cumulative Word Length Distributions for Several Languages

Generating Random Text with Style
---------------------------------

We have used frequency distributions to count the number of occurrences of
each word in a text.  Here will will generalize this idea to look at the
distribution of words in a given context.
A `conditional frequency distribution`:dt: is a collection
of frequency distributions, each one for a different condition.
Here the condition will be the preceding word.

In Listing random_, we've defined a function ``train_model()`` which
uses ``ConditionalFreqDist()`` to count words as they appear
relative to the context defined by the preceding word (stored in ``prev``).
It scans the corpus, incrementing the appropriate counter, and
updating the value of ``prev``.  The function ``generate_model()``
contains a simple loop to generate text: we set an initial
context, pick the most likely token in that context as our next
word (using ``max()``), and then use that word as our new context.
This simple approach to text generation tends to get stuck in loops;
another method would be to randomly choose the next word from among
the available words.

.. pylisting:: random
   :caption: Generating Random Text in the Style of Genesis

    def train_model(text):
        cfdist = nltk.ConditionalFreqDist()
        prev = None
        for word in text:
            cfdist[prev].inc(word)
            prev = word
        return cfdist
        
    def generate_model(cfdist, word, num=20):
        for i in range(num):
            print word,
            word = cfdist[word].max()

    >>> model = train_model(corpus.genesis.read())
    >>> list(model['living'])
    ['substance', ',', '.', 'thing', 'soul', 'creature']
    >>> generate_model(model, 'living')
    living creature that he said, I will not be a wife of the land
    of the land of the land

.. TODO: simple concordancing


Collocations
------------

Collocations are pairs of content words that occur together more
often than one would expect if the words of a document were scattered randomly.
We can find collocations by counting how many times a pair of words
*w*\ :subscript:`1`, *w*\ :subscript:`2` occurs together, compared
to the overall counts of these words (this program uses
a heuristic related to the `mutual information`:dt: measure,
``http://www.collocations.de/``)
In Listing collocations_ we try this for the items in the webtext corpus.

.. pylisting:: collocations
   :caption: A Simple Program to Find Collocations

    def collocations(words):
        from operator import itemgetter

        # Count the words and bigrams
        wfd = nltk.FreqDist(words)
        pfd = nltk.FreqDist(tuple(words[i:i+2]) for i in range(len(words)-1))

        # 
        scored = [((w1,w2), score(w1, w2, wfd, pfd)) for w1, w2 in pfd]
        scored.sort(key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)
        return map(itemgetter(0), scored)

    def score(word1, word2, wfd, pfd, power=3):
        freq1 = wfd[word1]
        freq2 = wfd[word2]
        freq12 = pfd[(word1, word2)]
        return freq12 ** power / float(freq1 * freq2)

    >>> for item in corpus.webtext.items:

   Use the program in Listing print-freq_ to find out how many word types account for a third
   of all word tokens, for a variety of text sources.  What do you conclude about this statistic?
   Read more about this on *LanguageLog*, at ``http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003993.html``.

#. |soso| Modify the text generation program in Listing random_ further, to
   do the following tasks:
   
   a) Store the *n* most likely words in a list ``lwords`` then randomly
      choose a word from the list using ``random.choice()``.

   b) Select a particular genre, such as a section of the Brown Corpus,
      or a genesis translation, one of the Gutenberg texts, or one of the Web texts.  Train
      the model on this corpus and get it to generate random text.  You
      may have to experiment with different start words. How intelligible
      is the text?  Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this method of
      generating random text.

   c) Now train your system using two distinct genres and experiment
      with generating text in the hybrid genre.  Discuss your observations.

#. |soso| Write a program to print the most frequent bigrams
   (pairs of adjacent words) of a text,
   omitting non-content words, in order of decreasing frequency.

#. |soso| Write a program to create a table of word frequencies by genre,
   like the one given above for modals.  Choose your own words and
   try to find words whose presence (or absence) is typical of a genre.
   Discuss your findings.

#. |soso| **Zipf's Law**:
   Let *f(w)* be the frequency of a word *w* in free text. Suppose that
   all the words of a text are ranked according to their frequency,
   with the most frequent word first. Zipf's law states that the
   frequency of a word type is inversely proportional to its rank
   (i.e. *f.r = k*, for some constant *k*). For example, the 50th most
   common word type should occur three times as frequently as the
   150th most common word type.

   a) Write a function to process a large text and plot word
      frequency against word rank using ``pylab.plot``. Do
      you confirm Zipf's law? (Hint: it helps to use a logarithmic scale).
      What is going on at the extreme ends of the plotted line?

   #) Generate random text, e.g. using ``random.choice("abcdefg ")``,
      taking care to include the space character.  You will need to
      ``import random`` first.  Use the string
      concatenation operator to accumulate characters into a (very)
      long string.  Then tokenize this string, and generate the Zipf
      plot as before, and compare the two plots.  What do you make of
      Zipf's Law in the light of this?

#. |soso| **Exploring text genres:**
   Investigate the table of modal distributions and look for other patterns.
   Try to explain them in terms of your own impressionistic understanding
   of the different genres.  Can you find other closed classes of words that
   exhibit significant differences across different genres?

WordNet: An English Lexical Database
------------------------------------

`WordNet`:idx: is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English,
similar to a traditional thesaurus but with a richer structure.
WordNet groups words into synonym sets, or `synsets`:dt:, each with
its own definition and with links to other synsets.
WordNet 3.0 data is distributed with NLTK, and includes 145,000
synsets.

Although WordNet was originally developed for research
in psycholinguistics, it is widely used in NLP and Information Retrieval.
WordNets are being developed for many other languages, as documented
at ``http://www.globalwordnet.org/``.

Senses and Synonyms
-------------------

Consider the following sentence:

.. _carex1:
.. ex::
   Benz is credited with the invention of the motorcar.

If we replace `motorcar`:lx: in carex1_ by `automobile`:lx:, the
meaning of the sentence stays pretty much the same:

.. _carex2:
.. ex::
   Benz is credited with the invention of the automobile.

Since everything else in the sentence has remained unchanged, we can
conclude that the words `motorcar`:lx: and `automobile`:lx: have the
same meaning, i.e. they are `synonyms`:dt:. 

In order to look up the senses of a word, we need to pick
a part of speech for the word.  WordNet contains four dictionaries: ``N``
(nouns), ``V`` (verbs), ``ADJ`` (adjectives), and ``ADV``
(adverbs). To simplify our discussion, we will focus on the ``N``
dictionary here.  Let's look up `motorcar`:lx: in the ``N`` dictionary.

    >>> car = wordnet.N['motorcar']
    >>> car
    motorcar (noun)

The variable ``car`` is now bound to a ``Word`` object.
Words will often have more than sense, where each
sense is represented by a synset. However,
`motorcar`:lx: only has one sense in WordNet, as we can discover
using ``len()``.  We can then find the synset (a set of
lemmas), the words it contains, and a gloss.

    >>> len(car)
    1
    >>> car[0]
    {noun: car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar}
    >>> [word for word in car[0]]
    ['car', 'auto', 'automobile', 'machine', 'motorcar']
    >>> car[0].gloss
    'a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an
    internal combustion engine; 
    "he needs a car to get to work"'

The ``wordnet`` module also defines ``Synset``\ s.
Let's look at a word which is `polysemous`:dt:\ ;
that is, which has multiple synsets:

    >>> poly = wordnet.N['pupil']
    >>> for synset in poly:
    ...     print synset
    {noun: student, pupil, educatee}
    {noun: pupil}
    {noun: schoolchild, school-age_child, pupil}
    >>> poly[1].gloss
    'the contractile aperture in the center of the iris of the eye;
    resembles a large black dot'

The WordNet Hierarchy
---------------------

WordNet synsets correspond to abstract concepts, which may or may not
have corresponding words in English.  These concepts are linked together in a hierarchy.
Some are very general, such as *Entity*, *State*, *Event* |mdash| these are called
`unique beginners`:dt:.  Others, such as *gas guzzler* and
*hatchback*, are much more specific. A small portion of a concept
hierarchy is illustrated in Figure wn-hierarchy_. The edges between nodes
indicate the hypernym/hyponym relation; the dotted line at the top is
intended to indicate that *artefact* is non-immediate hypernym of
*motorcar*. 

.. _wn-hierarchy:
.. figure:: ../images/wordnet-hierarchy.png
   :scale: 15

   Fragment of WordNet Concept Hierarchy

WordNet makes it easy to navigate between concepts.
For example, given a concept like *motorcar*,
we can look at the concepts which are more specific;
the (immediate) `hyponyms`:dt:. Here is one way to carry out this
navigation:

    >>> for concept in car[0][wordnet.HYPONYM][:10]:
    ... 	print concept
    {noun: ambulance}
    {noun: beach_wagon, station_wagon, wagon, estate_car, beach_waggon, station_waggon, waggon}
    {noun: bus, jalopy, heap}
    {noun: cab, hack, taxi, taxicab}
    {noun: compact, compact_car}
    {noun: convertible}
    {noun: coupe}
    {noun: cruiser, police_cruiser, patrol_car, police_car, prowl_car, squad_car}
    {noun: electric, electric_automobile, electric_car}
    {noun: gas_guzzler}

|nopar|
We can also move up the hierarchy, by looking at broader concepts than
*motorcar*, e.g. the immediate `hypernym`:dt: of a concept:

    >>> car[0][wordnet.HYPERNYM]
    [{noun: motor_vehicle, automotive_vehicle}]

We can also look for the hypernyms of hypernyms.  In fact, from any
synset we can trace (multiple) paths back to a unique beginner.
Synsets have a method for doing this, called ``tree()``,
which produces a nested list structure.

    >>> pprint(wordnet.N['car'][0].tree(wordnet.HYPERNYM))
    [{noun: car, auto, automobile, machine, motorcar},
     [{noun: motor_vehicle, automotive_vehicle},
      [{noun: self-propelled_vehicle},
       [{noun: wheeled_vehicle},
        [{noun: vehicle},
         [{noun: conveyance, transport},
          [{noun: instrumentality, instrumentation},
           [{noun: artifact, artefact},
            [{noun: whole, unit},
             [{noun: object, physical_object},
              [{noun: physical_entity}, [{noun: entity}]]]]]]]],
        [{noun: container},
         [{noun: instrumentality, instrumentation},
          [{noun: artifact, artefact},
           [{noun: whole, unit},
            [{noun: object, physical_object},
             [{noun: physical_entity}, [{noun: entity}]]]]]]]]]]]

A related method ``closure()`` produces a flat version of this structure,
with repeats eliminated.
Both of these functions take an optional ``depth`` argument which permits
us to limit the number of steps to take.
(This is important when using unbounded relations like ``SIMILAR``.)
Table wordnet-rel_ lists the most important lexical relations supported
by WordNet; see ``dir(wordnet)`` for a full list.

.. table:: wordnet-rel

   ===========  ================  ==============================================
   Hypernym     more general      `animal`:lx: is a hypernym of `dog`:lx:
   Hyponym      more specific     `dog`:lx: is a hypernym of `animal`:lx:
   Meronym      part of           `door`:lx: is a meronym of `house`:lx:
   Holonym      has part          `house`:lx: is a holonym of `door`:lx:
   Synonym      similar meaning   `car`:lx: is a synonym of `automobile`:lx:
   Antonym      opposite meaning  `like` is an antonym of `dislike`:lx:
   Entailment   necessary action  `step` is an entailment of `walk`:lx:
   ===========  ================  ==============================================

   Major WordNet Lexical Relations

Recall that we can iterate over the words of a synset, with ``for word in synset``.
We can also test if a word is in a dictionary, e.g. ``if word in wordnet.V``.
As our last task, let's put these together to find "animal words" that are used as verbs.
Since there are a lot of these, we will cut this off at depth 4.
Can you think of the animal and verb sense of each word?

    >>> animals = wordnet.N['animal'][0].closure(wordnet.HYPONYM, depth=4)
    >>> [word for synset in animals for word in synset if word in wordnet.V]
    ['pet', 'stunt', 'prey', 'quarry', 'game', 'mate', 'head', 'dog',
     'stray', 'dam', 'sire', 'steer', 'orphan', 'spat', 'sponge',
     'worm', 'grub', 'pooch', 'toy', 'queen', 'baby', 'pup', 'whelp',
     'cub', 'kit', 'kitten', 'foal', 'lamb', 'fawn', 'bird', 'grouse',
     'hound', 'bulldog', 'stud', 'hog', 'baby', 'fish', 'cock', 'parrot',
     'frog', 'beetle', 'bug', 'bug', 'queen', 'leech', 'snail', 'slug',
     'clam', 'cockle', 'oyster', 'scallop', 'scollop', 'escallop', 'quail']

WordNet Similarity
------------------

.. TODO: discuss WSD, mention Semcor, give pine cone example

.. It is often useful to be able to tell whether two lexical concepts are
   `semantically related`:dt:. For example, in order to check whether a
   particular instance of the word `bank`:lx: means
   *financial institution*, we can count the number of nearby words
   that are semantically related to this sense.  Using WordNet, we can
   investigate whether semantic relatedness can be
   expressed in terms of the graph structure of the concept hierarchy. 

We would expect that the semantic similarity of two concepts
would correlates with the length of the path between them in WordNet.
The ``wordnet`` package includes a variety of measures
which incorporate this basic insight.  For example,
``path_similarity`` assigns a score in the range 0\ |ndash|\
1, based on the shortest path that connects the concepts in the hypernym
hierarchy (-1 is returned in those cases where a path cannot be
found).  A score of 1 represents identity, i.e., comparing a sense with
itself will return 1.
    
    >>> wordnet.N['poodle'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.N['dalmatian'][1])
    0.33333333333333331
    >>> wordnet.N['dog'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.N['cat'][0])
    0.20000000000000001
    >>> wordnet.V['run'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.V['walk'][0])
    0.25
    >>> wordnet.V['run'][0].path_similarity(wordnet.V['think'][0])
    -1

Several other similarity measures are provided in ``wordnet``:
Leacock-Chodorow, Wu-Palmer, Resnik, Jiang-Conrath, and Lin.
For a detailed comparison of various measures, see [Budanitsky2006EWB]_.

Conclusion
----------

In this chapter we saw that we can do a variety of interesting
language processing tasks that focus solely on words.  Tokenization
turns out to be far more difficult than expected.
No single solution works well across-the-board, and we
must decide what counts as a token depending on the application
domain.  We also looked at normalization (including lemmatization) and
saw how it collapses distinctions between tokens.  In the next chapter
we will look at word classes and automatic tagging.

Summary
-------

* we can read text from a file ``f`` using ``text = open(f).read()``
* we can read text from a URL ``u`` using ``text = urlopen(u).read()``
* NLTK comes with many corpora, e.g. the Brown Corpus, ``corpus.brown``.
* a word token is an individual occurrence of a word in a particular context
* a word type is the vocabulary item, independent of any particular use of that item
* tokenization is the segmentation of a text into basic units |mdash| or tokens |mdash|
  such as words and punctuation.
* tokenization based on whitespace is inadequate for many applications because it
  includes bundles punctuation together with words
* lemmatization is a process that maps the various forms of a word (such as `appeared`:lx:, `appears`:lx:)
  to the canonical or citation form of the word, also known as the lexeme or lemma (e.g. `appear`:lex:).
* a frequency distribution is a collection of items along with their frequency counts (e.g. the words of a
  text and their frequency of appearance).
* WordNet is a semantically-oriented dictionary of English, consisting of synonym sets |mdash| or synsets |mdash|
  and organized into a hierarchical network.
