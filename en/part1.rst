**Introduction to Part I**

Part I covers the linguistic and computational analysis of words.
You will learn how to extract the words out of documents and
text collections in multiple languages, automatically
categorize them as nouns, verbs, etc, and access their meanings.
Part I also introduces the required programming skills along
with basic statistical methods.

    <title>The Language Challenge</title>

  Yet language presents us with far
          more than a temporary challenge for computation.  Consider the following
          sentences which attest to the riches of language:
    </para>

    <example role="linguistic"><title/>
        <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
            <listitem><para>Overhead the day drives level and grey, hiding the sun by a flight of grey spears.  (William Faulkner, <emphasis>As I Lay Dying</emphasis>, 1935)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>When using the toaster please ensure that the exhaust fan is turned on. (sign in dormitory kitchen)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Amiodarone weakly inhibited CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4-mediated activities with Ki values of 45.1-271.6 |mu|\ M (Medline, PMID: 10718780)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Iraqi Head Seeks Arms (spoof news headline)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The earnest prayer of a righteous man has great power and wonderful results. (James 5:16b)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe (Lewis Carroll, <emphasis>Jabberwocky</emphasis>, 1872)</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>There are two ways to do this, AFAIK :smile:  (internet discussion archive)</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
    </example>
    
    <para>Thanks to this richness, the study of language is part of many
          disciplines outside of linguistics, including translation, literary
          criticism, philosophy, anthropology and psychology.  Many less obvious
          disciplines investigate language use, such as law, hermeneutics,
          forensics, telephony, pedagogy, archaeology, cryptanalysis and speech
          pathology.  Each applies distinct methodologies to gather
          observations, develop theories and test hypotheses.  Yet all serve to
          deepen our understanding of language and of the intellect that is
          manifested in language.

        Part I of this book introduces the approach to the study of language
        known as <emphasis>Natural Language Processing</emphasis> (NLP), with a focus on the 
        linguistic and computational analysis of words.
        You will learn how to extract the words out of documents and
        text collections in multiple languages, automatically
        categorize them as nouns, verbs, etc, and access their meanings.
        Part I also introduces the required programming skills along
        with basic statistical methods.
