**Introduction to Part I**

Part I covers the linguistic and computational analysis of words.
You will learn how to extract the words out of documents and
text collections in multiple languages, automatically
categorize them as nouns, verbs, etc, and access their meanings.
Part I also introduces the required programming skills along
with basic statistical methods.

    <title>The Language Challenge</title>

    <para>Today, people from all walks of life Ñ including professionals, students,
          and the general population Ñ are confronted by
          unprecedented volumes of information, the vast bulk of which is stored
          as unstructured text. In 2003, it was estimated that the annual
          production of books amounted to 8 Terabytes. (A Terabyte is 1,000
          Gigabytes, i.e., equivalent to 1,000 pickup trucks filled with books.)
          It would take a human being about five years to read the new
          scientific material that is produced every 24 hours.  Although these
          estimates are based on printed materials, increasingly the information
          is also available electronically. Indeed, there has been an explosion of text
          and multimedia content on the World Wide Web.  For many people, a
          large and growing fraction of work and leisure time is spent
          navigating and accessing this universe of information.
    </para>
       
    <para>The presence of so much text in electronic form is a huge challenge to
          NLP. Arguably, the only way for humans to cope with the information
          explosion is to exploit computational techniques that can sift
          through huge bodies of text.  Yet language presents us with far
          more than a temporary challenge for computation.  Consider the following
          sentences which attest to the riches of language:

            <listitem><para>Overhead the day drives level and grey, hiding the sun by a flight of grey spears.  (William Faulkner, <emphasis>As I Lay Dying</emphasis>, 1935)</para></listitem>

            <listitem><para>There are two ways to do this, AFAIK :smile:  (internet discussion archive)</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
    </example>
    
    <para>Thanks to this richness, the study of language is part of many
          disciplines outside of linguistics, including translation, literary
          criticism, philosophy, anthropology and psychology.  Many less obvious
          disciplines investigate language use, such as law, hermeneutics,
          forensics, telephony, pedagogy, archaeology, cryptanalysis and speech
          pathology.  Each applies distinct methodologies to gather
          observations, develop theories and test hypotheses.  Yet all serve to
          deepen our understanding of language and of the intellect that is
          manifested in language.

        Part I of this book introduces the approach to the study of language
        known as <emphasis>Natural Language Processing</emphasis> (NLP), with a focus on the 
        linguistic and computational analysis of words.
        You will learn how to extract the words out of documents and
        text collections in multiple languages, automatically
        categorize them as nouns, verbs, etc, and access their meanings.
        Part I also introduces the required programming skills along
