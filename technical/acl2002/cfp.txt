INTRODUCTION

Natural Language Processing (and Computational Linguistics) courses have
been enjoying a large interest in the last few years. More and more
universities are offering both introductory and advanced classes. Over the
years, faculty from different departments have been developing their classes
by introducing and refining new lectures, software, and projects. Some of
the main challenges in teaching NLP are:

  1. Teaching to a diverse audience, consisting of a mix of students in
     Linguistics, Computer Science, Information Science, and Bioinformatics;
     both undergraduate and graduate; and with a wide range of proficiency
     in linguistics, computer theory, or programming.
  2. Selecting an appropriate focus for a course, e.g., theory vs.
     applications, symbolic vs. empirical, text-only vs. text+speech, etc.
  3. Finding an appropriate place of an NLP/CL course within a larger
     curriculum, e.g., in Artificial Intelligence, Computational
     Linguistics, Cognitive Science, or Language Engineering.
  4. Finding the right links to related areas, such as Theoretical
     Linguistics, Information Retrieval, Speech Science, Cognitive Science,
     Artificial Intelligence, or Genetic/Molecular Biology.
  5. Choosing appropriate assignments to provide the right mix of
     theoretical, programming and data analysis exercises.
  6. Designing software for educational purposes and developing tutorials on
     existing software.

This ACL workshop on Effective Tools and Methodologies for Teaching NLP/CL
will address these challenges. The workshop will bring together college
faculty with experience in teaching such courses as well as future teachers
(e.g., current graduate students).

CALL FOR PAPERS

We will be soliciting short papers (4-6 pages) on the following topics:

  1. Effective course lectures
  2. Innovative assignments and projects
  3. Educational software
  4. Web resources
  5. Curriculum issues (e.g., developing an effective multi-course CL
     program)
  6. Teaching NLP in different departments: Computer Science, Linguistics,
     Information Science, etc.
  7. Connecting teaching and research
  8. Seminar-style courses
  9. Choice of programming languages (and programming requirements in
     general)
 10. Teaching NLP in languages other than English
 11. Evaluation issues (outcomes assessment, educational measurement, etc.)

In addition to these papers, the organizers will be collecting pointers to
educational resources on the Web, including course notes, assignments,
tutorials, software, and demos.

The workshop will feature a panel discussing longer-term activities such as
a mailing list for instructors, an archive of educational materials, etc.

Submissions should be formatted according to the ACL style guide
(http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/acl02/style) and must be in either PS,
PDF, or DOC format. These should be sent electronically to radev@umich.edu
by the deadline shown below. Hard copies will be accepted only if the
authors explicitly make such arrangements the co-chairs at least one week
prior to the official submission date. In that case, the hard copies will
still have to arrive by the submission date.

We will assemble printed proceedings, however the ultimate goal of this
workshop would be laying the groundwork for further professional
collaboration in teaching NLP/CL, creating an ACL SIG, and building a
clearinghouse for educational materials.

IMPORTANT DATES

Papers due:                             March 29, 2002
Acceptance or rejection notification:   April 22, 2002
Camera-ready versions due:              May   17, 2002

REGISTRATION

Registration fees are $50 for regular participants and $0 (free) for up to
10 lower income participants (e.g., graduate students and/or participants
from Eastern Europe, Africa, and other disadvantaged areas of the world).

Candidates for registration fee waivers should indicate their interest to
the program co-chairs by April 22. Authors of accepted papers will have
priority, then authors of rejected papers, then all others.
