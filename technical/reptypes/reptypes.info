name: Basic Representation Types

abstract:
  The natural language toolkit allows students to manipulate a number
  of conceptual objects, such as words, sentences, and syntax
  trees. Before we can build a consistant framework for manipulating
  such objects, we must decide how they should be represented. This
  technical report explains basic types used by the toolkit to
  represent a number of conceptual objects. Furthermore, it attempts
  to justify why this set of basic types was chosen.
