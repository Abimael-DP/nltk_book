name: Printing
abstract:
  One thing that guides peoples intuitions about what an object is is
  how it looks when it prints. If two things look the same when you
  print them, then intuitively they should be the same. I think this may
  have been a source of confusion in the first problem set, where Tokens
  look just like strings when you print them, so users will be tempted
  to do things like use == to test whether a TokenType is equal to a
  string.
