\begin{block}{Major sub-domains of NLP}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding
    \item Translation
    \item Generation
  \end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Modalities}
  \begin{itemize}

  \frametitle{Textual Inference}


\begin{exampleblock}{Example 1}
  \begin{description}
    \item [Text] Never before had ski racing, a sport dominated by
      monosyllabic mountain men, seen the likes of Alberto Tomba, the
      flamboyant Bolognese flatlander who at 21 captured two gold
      medals at the Calgary Olympics.
    \item [Hypothesis] Alberto Tomba won a race.
  \end{description}
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example 2}
  \begin{description}
    \item [Text] Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health
      say that people who drink coffee may be doing a lot more than
      keeping themselves awake---this kind of consumption apparently
      also can help reduce the risk of diseases.
    \item [Hypothesis] Coffee drinking has health benefits.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item QA, Summarization, Dialog (NL understanding; holy grail of NLP)
    \item RTE
    \item Low-level components
    \item ambiguity, why NLP is hard, PP attachment, combinatorial explosion
    \item limitations of NLP, avoiding AI-completeness
    \item statistical vs rule-based
    \item limitations of just throwing more data at a problem
